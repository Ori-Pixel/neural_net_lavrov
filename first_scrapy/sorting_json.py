{"Title": "Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's interview with Rossiya 1 television channel for the documentary Antarctica: 200 Years of Peace, Moscow, February 2, 2020", "articleID": "4016132", "article_URL": "https://www.mid.ru/en/press_service/minister_speeches/-/asset_publisher/7OvQR5KJWVmR/content/id/4016132", "ArticleText": "Toggle navigation      / / Asset Publisher 2 February 2020 163-02-02-2020  Good afternoon, Mr Lavrov.  Good afternoon.  I don't suppose you've been to Antarctica?  Not yet, unfortunately.  Let me tell you about it. I flew there from Chile. At the airport, I asked where border control is? They replied that there's no need for it, because I wouldn't be leaving Chile but would only be travelling to Chile's Antarctic sector. Why didn't the Soviet Union try to get a sector?  Nobody tried to get any sectors. Antarctica, which was discovered 200 years ago by the first Russian expedition of Faddey Bellinsgauzen and Mikhail Lazarev, is a continent where international relations, as it was decided after long disputes, are guided by the Antarctic Treaty signed 60 years ago. The 1959 Antarctic Treaty sets out the principles that regulate the activities of all countries in Antarctica. First of all, the contracting parties pledged to use Antarctica for peaceful purposes only, preserve its biological resources and prohibit all activities relating to Antarctic mineral resources, except for scientific research (the latter provision was confirmed by the contracting parties for at least 50 years at their meeting in Madrid in 1991). The treaty also bans any measures of a military nature, such as the establishment of military bases, the carrying out of military manoeuvres, as well as the testing of any type of weapons. There is also a provision on cooperation based on mutual respect and conducted in the interests of the whole of humankind. Bellinsgauzen and Lazarev were the first to discover that Antarctica is a continent. British and American expeditions went there after them, but Russians were the first to discover that Antarctica is not an ice wall but a continent. Therefore, Antarctica does not belong to anyone.  It is true that last century a number of countries - Great Britain, Norway, Chile, Australia and New Zealand - made claims for a part of the continent and adjacent waters of the Southern Ocean, which are called \"sectors.\"  They marked triangles on the map.  That's right, triangles. Back then, the Soviet Union and the United States made a joint statement on peremptory non-recognition of any claims and refusal to divide Antarctica into sectors in order to preserve the continent as the common heritage of the humankind where research projects are implemented to the benefit of all. That mutual agreement was sealed. There is a right to claim a part of Antarctica, but there is a huge distance between laying claim and getting it. Therefore, this issue is not on the agenda now. It appears that Russia's and the United States' stance on Antarctica is one of the issues that they have complete unanimity on.  That is true - and this is not the only issue. Since its discovery, Antarctica has been a sort of honeypot, a continent that everyone sought to claim a part of. It even came to serious interstate disputes.   There was even shooting.  There was. But ultimately everything was settled by peaceful means, and I think this experience should be used to settle today's conflicts.  Antarctica was almost a reason for a recent war. I mean the Falklands (Malvinas) War waged for the islands located slightly north of Antarctica. They are not part of Antarctica.  But overlooking it. How sure can we be that the Antarctic Treaty will remain in effect and the world will not descend into another armed conflict?  I believe no one wants to undermine the Treaty. The 43rd Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting will be held in May-June this year. It will also mark the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica by Russian explorers. There are no signs of putting the Treaty at risk. On the contrary, I believe that cooperation on the South Pole is a remarkable example of relations between countries that set their ideological differences aside to focus on research and a peaceful development of this shared heritage. Can you tell me as a diplomat, not a researcher, why Russia has so many bases in Antarctica?  As a matter of fact, a scientific view is more important here. I doubt that diplomats would have made such a huge number of discoveries as our scientists. Take the discovery of a subglacial lake made at the end of last century. This lake was covered by a four-kilometre layer of ice and so had no contact with the Earth's surface for millions of years. This unique discovery is helping us to learn increasingly more about the Earth and its origins. As for diplomacy, this offers us direct benefits because we can share experience, demonstrate the achievements made by our people and thereby strengthen Russia's international standing. When we are doing well in the economy and science, it is easier for us to \"make\" foreign policy.  It is said that Antarctic stations are like mineral claims. Or is this a geopolitical fantasy?  Stations are nothing more than stations. We don't need visas to fly to Antarctica. It is a unique part of the world. I believe that we should tread very carefully when it comes to initiatives on modifying the regime set out in the Antarctic Treaty.  I have a question for you as a canoer. Just to imagine that Bellinsgauzen and Lazarev set out in their sloops across the ocean into that ice region... Come to think of it, this is a heroic part of global history.  I am not a canoer. Rather I'm a rafter. A raft is more reliable than a canoe. Nevertheless, I cannot imagine how they travelled back then. By the way, our diplomats greatly contributed to organising that expedition. All our ambassadors and consuls general located along the expedition's route were instructed to provide assistance, including food and equipment such as binoculars and spy glasses, as well as many other items. Of course, the fact that there were no major problems during the expedition - nobody died or got scurvy, as many had feared - is proof of the attention given to it by the state, including the diplomatic service, along the entire route.

Using this opportunity I would like to congratulate all those present on this important occasion. The exhibition you are seeing today contains much material on the rich history of our bilateral cooperation, the foundation for which was laid in a distant 1950. These stands display copies of telegrams that formed the basis of our bilateral cooperation at the official level and excerpts from the correspondence of top Soviet and Indonesian leaders. We are proud that this country made a substantial contribution to the development of a young Indonesian statehood and Indonesia's national economy, including its transport and industrial infrastructure and helped the new state build many plants and factories and its military capability. Of course, all of this contributed to the strengthening of Jakarta's position in the world arena. During the past 70 years we have managed to amass unique experience in cooperation in many diverse areas, and we steadily continue developing our relations today. I would like to mention our consistent, intensive political dialogue, including contacts at the top level. President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Indonesia Joko Widodo met in Sochi in May 2016 and Singapore in November 2018. We maintain regular contact by telephone. Now we are scheduling new meetings at the highest level. In addition to contact between our leaders, regular meetings are held by our ministries, including our foreign ministries, parliaments, companies and corporations.  I would like to mention the large-scale infrastructure projects in Indonesia being carried out with our leading companies, including Russian Railways and Rosneft. We have very strong prospects in agriculture, energy, transport, urban planning, innovation and high technology. The Russian-Indonesian joint commission on trade, economic and technical cooperation plays a big role in diversifying our cooperation. We are developing a trust-based dialogue on strategic security, as well as between judicial and law enforcement bodies. Last December our countries signed   a treaty on mutual legal assistance on criminal cases. We have completed our work on the intergovernmental agreement on cooperation in international information security. Needless to say, we are pleased to note our progress in military and military-technical relations. Strong humanitarian interaction, including education, tourist and sports exchanges, is strengthening the atmosphere of friendship in our relations. Over 300 Indonesian citizens are studying in Russia today. Russians have appreciated the hospitality of Indonesian resorts. The annual Indonesian festivals in Moscow and Russian cultural events in Indonesia have become a positive tradition. I would also like to mention our close and efficient foreign policy coordination that was raised to a new level after Indonesia's election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2019-2020.  I would also like to mention our strong contacts within the Russia-ASEAN partnership. Importantly, our Indonesian friends are acting as coordinator at present. I know that in relying on the rich traditions of friendship and mutual understanding, we will continue cooperating to reveal a truly inexhaustible potential in our bilateral ties for the benefit of our peoples and countries and our interests in security and stability in the Asia-Pacific Region. I am confident that the current circumstances make this a natural time to say that we have reached a level of strategic partnership in our relations. I know that we will be able to announce this soon. Let me congratulate all of you once again on this great day and wish you a good time.

I hope your stay will be beneficial and pleasant, as was mine in Jakarta in 2017 when we opened Russia's permanent mission to ASEAN. ASEAN is one of the most influential, authoritative and successful regional organisations.  It is the core of many multilateral associations in the Asia-Pacific Region. Relations with ASEAN are a priority in Russian foreign policy. We consider ASEAN to be our reliable partner in building an open and well-balanced system of equitable and indivisible security. Importantly, we believe that the 10 ASEAN countries are playing the central role in this system. We appreciate the fact that the Secretariat you head played a constructive and active role in raising Russia-ASEAN dialogue to       a strategic level in 2018. One of the results of this achievement was the improvement of our coordination at the UN and other international venues on key regional and international issues that are vital for Russia and ASEAN, including the efforts to counter terrorism, drug trafficking, transnational crime and WMD proliferation, and to ensure arms control and information security. In parallel, we are developing our cooperation in practical areas, including energy, the digital economy, agriculture, healthcare and environmental protection. To consolidate our versatile ties with ASEAN we are actively using the St Petersburg International Economic Forum and the Eastern Economic Forum, which are regularly attended by representatives of your states. Last year, Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad was one of the main guests at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. We expect ASEAN representatives to attend relevant top-level events this year. We are closely following the integration processes that are taking place in the Asia-Pacific Region. We are monitoring the analysis of these processes in ASEAN. Naturally, we see prospects in the alignment of relevant ASEAN plans with the initiative put forward by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the ASEAN summit in 2016, notably, the formation of the Greater Eurasian Partnership with the participation of the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), the SCO and ASEAN. I think it is symbolic that the first meeting during your visit took place at the Eurasian Economic Commission with the Chairman of its Council, Mikhail Myasnikovich. This was his first day working in this position. I am confident that your visit will promote our strategic partnership in all areas, practical cooperation and coordination of our actions on the international stage. Welcome.

It is a great honour for me to be able to speak again at the opening of this forum, which has firmly established itself as a respected platform for a constructive and candid exchange of views on many key issues of our time. The initiatives and recommendations that are developed as part of it make a meaningful contribution to ensuring harmonious development in Russia, strengthening civil, inter-ethnic, and inter-faith peace and harmony, and to rallying society around eternal values. This year marks the 75  anniversary of victory over Nazism. At the cost of inconceivable sacrifices and massive efforts that were unprecedented in world history, our country played a decisive role in destroying the Nazi war machine and liberating the European nations and the world in general from the brown plague and the ideology of Nazism. The threat to the Fatherland required the full mobilisation of not only our economic and organisational potential, but spiritual aspects as well. The peoples of the former Soviet Union illustrated examples of outstanding unity, courage, fortitude, patriotism, and a willingness to give up their lives for a just cause. The Russian Orthodox Church also contributed to this common effort. In the very first days of the war, it called upon everyone to defend the Motherland, organised fundraising for defence, provided moral support to soldiers and civilians, including those who ended up in a territory temporarily occupied by the enemy. It strongly condemned collaborators and traitors. Regretfully, I have to note that the attempts to rewrite the history of the war and use it as a tool in dirty geopolitical games have increased. This scourge has severely affected a number of European states, in which the glorification of Nazi henchmen had, in fact, become part of state ideology and policy. The shameful attacks on the monuments and graves of the liberating soldiers continue in Ukraine, the Baltic countries, Poland, the Czech Republic and a number of other countries in an enlightened Europe. Their goal is clear. It is to rake up historical and political complexes and phobias, to radically revise the international legal results of World War II and the results of Victory, including the fundamental principles of state-to-state communication as found in the UN Charter. It is regrettable that the memory of the war, its lessons and legacy are increasingly becoming prey to fleeting political interests. This is absolutely unacceptable. Contemporary and future politicians, statesmen and public figures must protect the good name of both living and fallen heroes, civilians, and the victims and accomplices of the Nazis. President Putin spoke emotionally about this in detail at the opening ceremony for the monument in honour of the Leningrad Siege and the Holocaust commemoration forum in Jerusalem on January 23. Our ministry is working hard to preserve the historical truth about the Great Patriotic War. In addition to our CSTO and CIS allies and partners, the vast majority of the international community agrees with us on this. The annual Russian initiative, On Combating Glorification of Nazism, traditionally enjoys widespread support at the UN. On December 18, 2019, at a plenary meeting of the 74  session of the UN General Assembly, a resolution was approved which condemns attempts to acquit Nazi movement members and the organisations recognised as criminal by the Nuremberg Tribunal rulings. The unacceptability of the destruction or desecration of memorials in honour of the liberators was emphasised. A special item, \"The 75  anniversary of the end of World War II,\" was included on the agenda of the current 75  session of the UN General Assembly at our suggestion. A special UN General Assembly meeting is scheduled to coincide with this anniversary. Commemorative, awareness and cultural events are being held abroad as part of the Victory anniversary celebration. We assign a special role to cooperating with the associations of Russian compatriots who have already begun organising sociopolitical actions, such as the St George Ribbon, Memory Watch, Red Star of Victory and, of course, the Immortal Regiment. The growing participation of young people in patriotic actions, which were not ordered from above, but are held at the call of the heart, is critically important. The anniversary celebrations will culminate in May 9 celebrations in Moscow. We anticipate the participation of many official delegations from foreign states, representatives of foreign public circles and veterans living abroad. Your Holiness, colleagues, The legal foundation of international architecture laid in the wake of the Great Victory remains the most important pillar in effectively overcoming the challenges and threats that are common to all peoples and in maintaining global and regional stability. This is what President Putin's initiative on holding, this year, a special summit with the leaders of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, which, under the UN Charter, have a special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, is designed to achieve. The leaders of China and France have already supported this initiative. It is called, in the most serious way, without politicisation or ideologisation, and without regard to electoral cycles, to consider ways to reduce tensions, which have been dangerously mounting in recent years, and to stop the world from sliding into confrontation. Meanwhile, the diplomatic service will continue to do its best to counter attempts to falsify history. We are open to close cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church and other traditional religions in our country in the interest of educating young people in the spirit of continuity of eras and generations and strengthening Russian society's moral and spiritual foundations. I know that these Christmas Readings will make the most important and effective contribution to these efforts. I wish all participants every success and good health in 2020.

We met in Sochi last October, on the sidelines of the Russia-Africa Summit, held a bilateral meeting and signed a memorandum on consultations between our two countries' foreign ministries. Today we have discussed the prospects of bilateral cooperation, first of all with an emphasis on the development of its economic element. We have spoken about the prospects in energy, transport, infrastructure development and personnel training. Our South Sudanese friends showed their interest in establishing contacts in all these areas. The first contacts between our countries' companies took place during the Russian Energy Week and the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, among other events. Based on those contacts, we came to share the opinion that it is necessary to expand them. We informed our colleagues about the Russian companies working in the oil and gas, infrastructure, railway and transport sectors that are ready to discuss possible mutually beneficial projects with our South Sudanese partners. We have agreed to promote direct contacts between our economic operators. We have also discussed ways of increasing the number of South Sudanese students at Russian universities. We can see our friends' interest in this area of cooperation as well. We have been reassured that Russian companies that will go to South Sudan will find themselves in a comfortable work environment, including security and conditions on which they will negotiate with their partners. Back in 2016, we signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on Military Technical Cooperation, which is still effective. We have agreed to use this sphere of cooperation in order to strengthen security and military capability of South Sudan, of course only after the UN Security Council lifts its the restrictions on weapons trade with that country. We have noted that the situation normalised in South Sudan thanks to the government's policy to implement its agreements with the opposition, including the armed opposition. We believe that the UN Security Council should take this reality into account in its assessments and resolutions. The more active the normalisation is and the more sustainable these trends become, the more opportunities there will be to develop trade, economic, cultural and other cooperation. We welcomed the efforts of the international community and regional organisations that help promote the normalisation of the domestic political situation in South Sudan and stressed how important it was to implement the agreement signed by all South Sudanese parties in Addis Ababa back in 2018. With regard to other issues on the international and regional agenda, we emphasised our readiness to further cooperate at the United Nations. We have the same approaches to the need to comply with all the norms and principles of the UN Charter, respecting sovereignty, independence and equality of all the UN member countries, resolving all problems exclusively by peaceful means and the unacceptability of the threat of force or use of force in violation of the UN Charter. We will coordinate our approaches to the issues on the UN agenda. We have thanked our friends for their continued support of Russia's main initiatives at the UN, including the new initiative first submitted for consideration to the UN General Assembly last autumn. I mean the resolution on strengthening and developing the system of agreements on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. This topic is crucial in the situation when the United States is trying to pull down this system and destroy the remaining multilateral tools that served as the base for the efforts to ensure strategic stability. With regard to the African agenda, we have also reaffirmed our position of support for the Africans' efforts to resolve their own problems. We share the view of the processes underway in Somalia, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the entire Africa's Great Lakes region. As a member of the UN Security Council, Russia will insist on respecting, first of all, the approaches developed by the African Union and sub-regional African organisations when discussing these and other conflicts in Africa. We have also reaffirmed our readiness to promote the normalisation between South Sudan and Sudan. There are still issues to be addressed after these countries' \"divorce.\" We support the countries' search for mutually acceptable solutions that take into account the balance of interests. We are very satisfied with the outcome of the talks, which will probable give a new boost to the development of our relations with this young African country. What are the reasons for the escalation in Idlib? What is the situation on the ground fraught with? What will happen with militants in this area? These questions are regularly answered at briefings in the defence and foreign ministries. The militants that are almost fully controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (the organisation Jabhat al-Nusra turned into and whose cover it is using) regularly violate ceasefire agreements. A ceasefire was announced at the initiative of Russia and Turkey in early January. Since then, radicals in Idlib have violated it dozens of times. They are attacking and shelling from different weapons and positions the Syrian army and civilian facilities. Attempts to send drones to attack the Russian air base in Khmeimim have not stopped. Needless to say, such armed provocations, during which dozens of civilians and Syrian army personnel have been killed and hundreds wounded this month alone, cannot remain unanswered. We are supporting the efforts of the Syrian army to suppress these provocations in the Idlib zone. Now I will say a few words about the lot of the militants staying there. First, if they are ready to disassociate themselves from terrorists as the Russian-Turkish memorandum of September 17, 2018 requires, they should do so. For the time being, we see that Jabhat al-Busra is playing the prevailing role in the guise of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which has been identified as a terrorist organisation by the UN Security Council and major regional players. They are consolidating their positions. Thus, many militants that are not members of terrorist structures go to fight in Libya, contrary to UN Security Council resolutions that declare unacceptable any interference in the Libyan domestic crisis. While militants are leaving the Idlib zone, the influence of the radicals there is becoming even stronger. Yesterday I discussed this in detail over the telephone with Foreign Minister of Turkey Mevlut Cavusoglu. We agreed to streamline our work on the implementation of agreements to separate the armed opposition that is patriotic and is ready to take part in the political process. Its members must disassociate from terrorists that are recognised as such by the UN Security Council. These agreements must be carried out. Naturally, we are doing all we can to persuade the Syrian leaders to respond proportionally to these provocations, fully taking into account the requirements of international humanitarian law and civilian needs. Militants from armed formations should stop any contacts with terrorists, while the latter should surrender - there can be no mercy for them. Humanitarian corridors have been created especially for civilians to get out of this zone. Terrorists continue to attack them, impeding civilians leaving and trying to use them as a human shield. Therefore, I would like to repeat that it is necessary to carry out honestly and fully the Russian-Turkish agreements without trying to gain time to let terrorists strengthen their positions and replenish their reserves. US President Donald Trump is hoping for \"the deal of the century.\" However, the Palestinians consider it to be a new plan against them, which is designed to get around the law and agreements with Israel. What is Russia's position on this issue? The \"deal of the century\" that the United States wants to offer for the Palestinian-Israeli settlement has been advertised for many years but we have not seen it. We were not told any details about it during our contacts with the Americans. All we were told was that it will resolve all the problems in one go. We know how the US administration always wants to find radical solutions to many international problems. However, this does not always produce positive results. We have heard comments on the gist of the \"deal of the century.\" There are some leaks. If these comments are authentic, it represents a fundamentally new approach to the resolution of problems between Palestine and Israel. This approach differs from everything that has been recognised by the international community as the foundation for a settlement so far (UN Security Council resolutions, the Madrid principles and the Arab Peace Initiative). Therefore, right now I am simply saying that this is what we think about it if these rumours are true. But, of course, we need to wait for the official publication of this proposal. I hope it will be published and will not be closed to the international community. When the text is published, it will be most important to identify the positions of the sides, primarily the position of the Palestinians because, as I far as I know, this proposal is about the creation of a Palestinian state, an issue on which the international community has adopted resolutions. Needless to say, it will be essential to understand the position of the Arab friends of Palestine and the Arab League, considering that it has made the Arab Peace Initiative, which was approved by the international community, an inalienable part of resolving the problem of the two states - Israel and Palestine. Naturally, I would very much like the quartet of international mediators - Russia, the United States, the UN and the EU - to analyse the situation as well. The mechanism, which has by and large remained idle in the past few years, is not being used in the search for mutually acceptable solutions. But let us not make any preliminary conclusions because rumours are rumours. We must wait for official proposals and understand the specific attitudes of the interested parties to them. Are there plans to evacuate Russian citizens because of the complicated epidemiological situation in Wuhan, China, due to the spread of coronavirus?  A special commission of the Russian Government is dealing with these issues. Members of this commission, for instance, Rosturism (Federal Agency for Tourism) and Rospotrebnadzor (Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare) have already expressed their opinion in this regard. We have nothing to add to their statements. All information is published on their websites. All our citizens, those who are in China now or planned to visit, can review it, and we hope they will come to the right conclusions and stay safe.

{"Title": "Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's opening remarks at a joint meeting of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Trustees of Russian Foreign Ministry's MGIMO University, Moscow, January 28, 2020", "articleID": "4006625", "article_URL": "https://www.mid.ru/en/press_service/minister_speeches/-/asset_publisher/7OvQR5KJWVmR/content/id/4006625", "ArticleText": "Toggle navigation      / / Asset Publisher 28 January 2020 133-28-01-2020 Esteemed colleagues, We are holding a regular joint meeting of MGIMO's Supervisory Board and the Board of Trustees. This format has traditionally been very effective. The very atmosphere on the eve of our meeting shows that we are going to have a businesslike, collegial discussion in the interests of our university. This past year we marked the 75  anniversary of our alma mater. Several events have been held both in Russia and abroad. I would like to make a special mention of the 5th MGIMO World Alumni Forum that took place in Uzbekistan. I will not list everything that was done during the past year but I am convinced that you will agree with me: our alma mater met its anniversary head on: with new achievements and practical activity. It has justified, in practice, the status of one of the main elements of domestic academic and science diplomacy. MGIMO graduates make meaningful contributions to the Foreign Ministry, the Security Council office and other government departments and organisations.  Our graduates are also in demand in politological society - organisations like the Valdai International Discussion Club, the Russian International Affairs Council, the Council on Foreign and Defence Policy and other research institutes. Publishing activities are being stepped up. The university's magazines are strengthening their status and receiving high ratings in foreign science citation indices. I would like to make a special mention of the expansion of the university's international ties. A breakthrough was made with the opening of the first full university affiliate abroad, in Tashkent. I visited it on January 16 this month and met with the students, professors and teachers. Now we are about ready to offer the MBA programme in finance in Baku in cooperation with the Diplomatic Academy of Azerbaijan. I believe we will find more forms of cooperation in the future. I would also like to mention the relevance of MGIMO's Geneva venue. The number of foreign students and interns is increasing and new education partnerships are growing stronger. Apart from the double and triple diploma programmes, MGIMO is part of the network of CIS, SCO and BRICS universities. I would like to mention the unique scientific and education consortium project that includes Russian and American universities and a master's programme on WMD non-proliferation. Both are highly relevant in our practical policy and I would like to emphasise this. MGIMO is making a substantial contribution to the development of bilateral interstate cooperation in other areas as well. It is acting as a basic university for dialogue between civil societies in France, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the ASEAN nations. Naturally, I am pleased to note that numerous foreign guests are always eager to get to MGIMO and they consider it important to give lectures to the students and academic personnel. This year MGIMO will take an active part in important international events held in Russia, especially the BRICS and SCO summits that Russia will host. MGIMO is a participant in many initiatives that accompany their summits and is the organizer of the Russia-ASEAN Youth Forum that will be held in Kazan next September. Needless to say, we and the university will focus on the issues related to the forthcoming anniversary of the Great Victory, and the anniversary of the UN foundation. The university has specific and very serious plans to take part in the common efforts to preserve the historical truth and prevent the revision of the results of the war against Nazism and World War II. The UN anniversary is directly linked with this. MGIMO Rector Anatoly Torkunov chairs the UN Association of Russia (UNA-Russia), so the university is simply obliged to take part in the anniversary events of this global organisation. I would also like to note that MGIMO does not limit itself to ties with foreign partners. It closely cooperates with Russian universities that specialise in engineering and the natural sciences (MISIS, MIPT and SCOLIPE). It is planning to cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture along with Russian producers and agrarian product exporters. It is very important to link the practical goals of our agriculture with MGIMO's scientific potential at this point. I would like to note that in the spring and summer of this year graduates in joint programmes carried out by MGIMO for the Ministry of Agriculture will fill the vacancies of agriculture attaches in our embassies abroad. Serious work has been started on the further buildup of the university's unique linguistic potential. Specialised units have already been established. MGIMO is always striving to meet the needs of this country. Ties with the regions are of special importance in this context. MGIMO is confidently expanding its enduring contacts with them: from central Russia to the Far East. It is also improving its cooperation with pre-university institutions and is upgrading its infrastructure. I believe the construction of a dormitory on Prospekt Vernadskogo will be completed this year. Today, the main item on our agenda is the strategy for MGIMO development in 2020-2025. Students, graduates and our partners have taken part in this project. This has been discussed at meetings between the Rector's Office and the Academic Council.  Now Mr Torkunov will present it to us.                  Advanced settings         Switcher      6 Photos close"},
{"Title": "Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's remarks and answers to media questions following talks with Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Mexico Marcelo Luis Ebrard Casaubon, Mexico City, February 6, 2020", "articleID": "4025776", "article_URL": "https://www.mid.ru/en/press_service/minister_speeches/-/asset_publisher/7OvQR5KJWVmR/content/id/4025776", "ArticleText": "Toggle navigation      / / Asset Publisher 7 February 2020 211-07-02-2020 Ladies and gentlemen, The visit of the Russian Foreign Minister and his delegation to Mexico is coming to an end. I believe the visit was very fruitful. We held highly constructive and useful talks with my Mexican counterpart, Mr Marcelo Luis Ebrard Casaubon. As you may know, the ties between our two nations have a long history. They were officially established 130 years ago: next December will see their anniversary and we have arranged with our Mexican colleagues today to celebrate this memorial date fittingly. We have confirmed our shared interest in strengthening bilateral relations in all areas without exception. We have discussed how to promote and intensify the political dialogue, including at the high and highest levels. We have come to an agreement on how to energise the efforts to enrich the legal infrastructure, including by speeding up the coordination of documents considered by the sides. Let me mention in this context the Agreement on Cultural Centres, the Agreement on Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and the Agreement Between the Law Enforcement Agencies, which is of practical importance for fighting terrorism. There was a separate discussion on the expedience of introducing a visa-free regime on the reciprocal basis. The overwhelming majority of Latin American and Caribbean states have already signed intergovernmental agreements on visa-free travel with the Russian Federation. We have paid much attention to trade and economic cooperation. Trade is growing, although there was a tendency towards its deceleration last year. But Mexico confidently remains Russia's second biggest partner in the region after Brazil. We have welcomed progress in the expansion of contacts between the business communities. We have noted in particular that the Russia-Mexico Entrepreneurial Committee created under the auspices of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry held its first meeting last April. We said that our companies were active in the two countries' markets. Lukoil is expanding its presence in Mexico, Mexico's Nemak, a car components manufacturer, has a facility in the Ulyanovsk Region of Russia, and the GRUMA International Food has opened a plant in the Moscow Region. I have cited just a few examples. There are many more of them. There are good prospects in view, as we have confirmed today, in energy, car-making, shipbuilding, the aircraft industry, the chemical industry, pharmaceuticals, rail transport and agriculture. We have made good progress in the area of military-technical cooperation: Mexico operates about 50 Russian-made helicopters and a helicopter servicing centre with a pilot-training school attached to it. There are prospects in this area as well. Generally, we share the opinion that we need to diversify our trade and investment ties, including by being more pro-active in using the potential of the Russia-Mexico Mixed Commission on Economic, Commercial, Scientific and Technological Cooperation and Maritime Navigation. Regrettably, this commission held its latest meeting in December 2011, but the current Government of Mexico is keen to reactivate this tool. We have agreed that the next session of the Intergovernmental Commission for Economic Cooperation will be held in Mexico later this year. Cultural exchanges are making progress. In addition to the Mixed Commission on Economic, Commercial, Scientific and Technological Cooperation and Maritime Navigation, there is a Mixed Commission on Cooperation in Culture, Education and Sports. Its most recent meeting took place in 2018, where a three-year programme for promoting cooperation and contacts in these spheres was adopted. We received an invitation from our Mexican colleagues to take part in the 48  Cervantino International Art Festival to be held in Guanajuato in October. We hope that Russia will be adequately represented at this important event. We also noted constructive contacts between the capitals of our respective countries. In December 2019, a Moscow Government delegation visited Mexico City and renewed the Cooperation Programme to 2022. Our colleagues were pleased to note an increase in the number of Russian tourists visiting Mexico. After we introduce visa-free entry, I think these numbers will be even more impressive. Educational exchanges are doing well. Russia regularly allocates publicly-funded scholarships to Mexican students. We positively noted a new form of Foreign Ministry Diplomatic Academy's cooperation with the Matias Romero Institute. The Russian Diplomatic Academy has been offering regular career development courses for Latin American diplomats since 2016. Mexican Foreign Ministry employees took the courses last autumn. We share common approaches when it comes to international issues which we discussed at length. Like our Mexican friends, we stand firmly on the solid foundation of the UN Charter, the principles of respect for sovereignty and equality of states, non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs and the settlement of disputes exclusively by peaceful means. We compared notes on the UN General Assembly's agenda. Mexico supports most of Russia's initiatives, including resolutions on countering the glorification of Nazism, non-deployment of weapons in outer space, establishing cooperation to build trust in outer space, international information security and our new resolution, which was first introduced during the most recent General Assembly session, which Mexico strongly supported. It is about taking additional practical measures to strengthen and develop the framework for arms control agreements, disarmament and non-proliferation. We discussed the situation in Latin America and the Caribbean. Russia is interested in seeing this region as an important element of the emerging multipolar world order both now and in the future. We exchanged views on specific crises which continue unabated in the Latin American region and agreed that the attempts to reanimate neo-colonial doctrines, such as the Monroe Doctrine, or to repeat the scenarios of the infamous colour revolutions are fraught with a dangerous increase in tension. We share similar views regarding the situation in and around Venezuela. Like Russia, Mexico stands for resolving the problems that exist and are piling up in that country exclusively through a dialogue between the government and the opposition and an inclusive dialogue between all significant political forces in that country. We expressed our mutual willingness to promote a dialogue between Russia and various integration associations in Latin America and the Caribbean and focused particularly on the Mexican chairmanship in the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). We welcomed our Mexican colleagues' plans to use their presidency to strengthen CELAC and to expand its foreign relations, including with our country. As part of our efforts to improve coordination in international affairs, we agreed to draft and, in the foreseeable future, sign a plan of consultations between our respective foreign ministries. I invited my colleague to pay a return visit to the Russian Federation. He accepted my invitation, and we will separately coordinate the date of his trip.  Do Mexico and Russia plan to launch a dialogue between President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro and the opposition on resolving the crisis in that country?  Russia and Mexico believe that it is necessary to address all of Venezuela's problems by solely peaceful methods through dialogue between all political forces, rather than in line with the Monroe Doctrine, as Washington suggests, or through attempts to provoke an armed confrontation and to obtain a pretext for an armed interference. Mexico co-founded what we call the Montevideo Mechanism. It also supported Norway's initiative to promote the Oslo process. Unfortunately, this process has now stalled because of the unpredictable behaviour of the self-proclaimed Mr Juan Guaido. There have been some positive shifts; I am talking about national dialogue, launched between the Government President Maduro and the patriotic opposition. Understandably, this dialogue does not involve all of the country's political forces. Just like Mexico, Russia advocates a more inclusive dialogue. No one can step in to resolve problems facing the people of Venezuela for them, but it is quite possible to obstruct their efforts to come to agreement. We are witnessing attempts that, as I have said, aim to provoke pretexts for an armed intervention. Russia and Mexico agree that this would be absolutely unacceptable. What companies are interested in Russia's involvement in megaprojects of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador? As for Russia's role in President Lopez Obrador's plans to develop the economy and the social sector, participants in a meeting of the Russian-Mexican Joint Commission on Economic, Trade, Scientific and Technical Cooperation and Sea Navigation will discuss these matters. Most importantly, we need to receive specific proposals from our Mexican friends as regards various areas to which, in their opinion, Russian companies can effectively contribute. The Mexican side has extensive information about the capabilities of Russian companies. We hope that it will be possible to formulate and discuss proposals that can help implement Mexico's plans with the involvement of Russian companies during the participation of Mexican delegations in forums taking place in Russia. I am talking about the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, the Eastern Economic Forum, the International Industrial Trade Fair INNOPROM and the Russian Energy Week. All these annual events are highly popular, and Mexican delegations have already participated in some of them. Today, we have invited our colleagues to send their representatives to the relevant forums due to take place this year. We would like to receive proposals on the specific areas where our Mexican colleagues believe Russian companies could contribute to the implementation of Mexico's economic development plans. You said that economic advances and changes were impending. During the talks did you discuss further efforts to develop the Mixed Commission on Economic, Commercial, Scientific and Technological Cooperation and Maritime Navigation?  The Mixed Commission on Economic, Commercial, Scientific and Technological Cooperation and Maritime Navigation has not met since 2011. Today, we agreed that its operations must be resumed. Its next meeting will be held in Mexico later on this year. The specific timeframes will be coordinated by our economic ministries.  You are going to Venezuela now. Is Russia interested in negotiating an exit for President Maduro? Could Mexico play any role? After all Mexico, unlike other countries in the region, has stayed on the sidelines on whether to back Guaido or Maduro. What are you actually going to take to Caracas as a proposal?  We do not take proposals to other capitals. We always respect our dialogue partners. You started by asking whether Russia could negotiate the terms for President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro's departure. We have been down that road before. The EU, represented by the so-called Lima Group, was promoting an initiative to this effect. We do not think that these initiatives are useful or productive. Our position - and that of Mexico - is that a national dialogue without preconditions is needed. If there are those who think (as our Western colleagues do) that a dialogue is a good thing but only if its aim is to discuss the regime change criteria, then, pardon me, this is imposing recipes from the outside rather than mediation. We hear from Washington that there can be no options other than the replacement of the current Government and President. They are openly making threats that all options are \"on the table.\" They regularly stage provocations, as was the case with the so-called human rights commission. This is not our approach, nor that of our Mexican partners. A dialogue without preconditions! It is only then that all sides will be able to come to terms on mutually acceptable solutions to overcome the current crisis. If the outcome of a dialogue is predetermined, this is diktat, not mediation. This is just about all I wanted to say. What comments would you make on the reports on the death of Russian and Turkish soldiers in northern Syria?  All comments were issued in Moscow. I have nothing to add. Is Russia planning to support the call by OPEC+ to cut oil production, as was suggested at a recent emergency meeting? How would you comment on the reports that the United States is going to introduce sanctions against a number of oil companies, including Rosneft?  We are actively supporting cooperation within the framework of OPEC+ and collaboration between oil exporting countries, including both OPEC and non-OPEC countries. President of Russia Vladimir Putin and King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia had a telephone conversation the other day, where this topic was also discussed, including in the light of the coronavirus epidemic's consequences for the global economy, which is slowing down, something that is certain to influence the oil market. We are interested in holding further consultations to define the optimal market regulation measures that would be acceptable for all oil exporters. The aim is to preclude the roller-coaster effect that can harm both producers and consumers. As for the second part of your question, I do not quite understand what  you mean. I heard yet another series of threats coming from Washington; they intend to punish everyone who cooperates with Venezuela in some way or another. We are used to this. We are used to hearing US officials say, without any scruples, that Washington is committed to the Monroe Doctrine and that this doctrine should be acted upon. If Latin American countries feel comfortable under this tutelage, it is your sovereign right. I think that this is an insult to all Latin American countries, no matter what position they hold on Venezuela or any other international problem.  Can you comment on the recent attacks by the Turkish Armed Forces on the Syrian Army which is Russia's ally?  I have already replied to this question that has already been raised. We provided all comments in Moscow. I can only say that we are in touch with our Turkish colleagues. We have reached agreements that clarify the regime of the Idlib de-escalation zone where our Turkish colleagues pledged to disengage the opposition that cooperates with them from Jabhat al-Nusra and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham terrorists. Unfortunately, these terrorists still rule supreme in the Idlib zone; therefore it is necessary to fulfil this obligation, no matter what. We discussed this with my Turkish colleague, Foreign Minister of Turkey Mevlut Cavusoglu who called me a few days ago. The very next day, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The second obligation implies the need to establish a so-called weapon-free area inside the Idlib de-escalation zone. We also coordinated this aspect. This goal has not been achieved yet. Our military are addressing these specific matters on the ground as per instructions from Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan. All efforts to suppress the terrorists are legal because no ceasefire agreements on Idlib and on complying with the ceasefire regime apply to terrorists who are outlawed and are not covered by any agreements. What are the purposes of your visit to the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean? What is your position regarding hypothetical Russian assistance to President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro?   The purpose of my visit is quite obvious. When Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mexico Marcelo Ebrard Casaubon and I met in September 2019 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, he kindly invited me to visit Mexico. I have arrived in line with his invitation. We find it customary to accept an invitation. Speaking of our relations with Venezuela, we do not stipulate any methods to support the Venezuelan authorities, except normal trade and economic ties. On the other hand, your American colleagues and ours are obsessed with the idea of their regional diktat. I have already mentioned official statements that the Monroe Doctrine is absolutely legitimate and lawful. This doctrine as well as all US actions in this context aim to undermine lawful, legitimate trade and economic ties in flagrant violation of the UN Charter and provisions of the World Trade Organisation. We are doing nothing, except what is allowed by international law. I hope that everyone who understands the unacceptability of current US actions with regard to Venezuela and a number of other countries will send the appropriate messages because this is not just a matter of a specific crisis in Venezuela or anywhere else, but concerns the destiny of the open global international trade system. Our American colleagues rudely ignore and undermine these principles. We also discuss this matter with them. Unfortunately, they show understanding at a certain level, but a striving to prevent anyone from contradicting the United States by any means prevails. It is impossible to go far using this position, but the realities of the modern world should someday force the Americans to realise that it is necessary to work in a multilateral format, rather than try to reinstate the absolutely futile unipolar model of the international order. This model is no more, and it will never reemerge.  It was reported earlier that Russia and Mexico were building up their military and technical cooperation. Have they managed to reach new agreements in this area? What share of the Latin American market does the production of the Russian defence industry sector currently hold?  I think that our military-technical products take a rightful place on the Latin American market. They are reputable. Many Latin American countries value quality, price and the warranty maintenance, and our products have all of that. In Mexico, the most important facility in this regard is the helicopter maintenance centre: a while back, some 50 Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters were delivered to the country. In Veracruz, there is a centre that provides helicopter repair and maintenance services, as well as training for Mexican helicopter operators. As for future prospects, the Mexican party is now considering a concrete proposal by Rosoboronexport, including additional contracts on helicopter deliveries.  Have you spoken about the nomination of Mexico as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council? Will Russia support Mexico's candidacy?  Mexico is one of the region's leading countries. It has an impeccable reputation in terms of approaches to international challenges such as strategic stability, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and most importantly, respect for the founding principles of the UN Charter. A group of Latin American and Caribbean states approved Mexico's candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for 2021-2022. There is no reason why the resolution to approve its membership in the UN Security Council should not be adopted by consensus. We hope that we will interact even more closely with our Mexican friends at the UN when they will be directly involved in the work of the Security Council in addition to solving issues discussed by the UN General Assembly and other UN bodies.  Can it be guaranteed that Russia-US relations will not affect relations between Russia and Mexico?  I have made a point of bringing along a quotation that caught my attention. Probably it will answer your question. Lisa Curtis, Senior Director for South and Central Asia on the  , was speaking at a Heritage Foundation conference in Washington the other day, and this is a quote from her remarks. Asked about Washington's estimate of Secretary of State Pompeo's recent tour of Central Asia (he visited Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan after a stopover in Ukraine and Belarus), she said this: \"Russia has always had a tremendous amount of influence in this region and we do not expect that to change. We are not trying to match that. We just want to be present; we want to provide alternatives for the countries. We want to continue to protect as much as we can their ability to be sovereign, independent nations, as we have always done since they became independent.\" If we put \"Russia\" instead of the United States and \"Latin America\" instead of Central Asia, I am ready to subscribe to each of these words. It is another matter that our US colleagues, while promoting these entirely correct postulates, are certain that they have the right to be present anywhere they want and that they alone can be present in the Western Hemisphere. If you read or listen to the cock-and-bull stories they write or spread by word of mouth about Russia's role in every single Latin American crisis, you will probably understand that analysing international developments is something that requires a slightly more serious attitude. When the well-known John Bolton, while still holding his White House job, declared that no one (meaning Russia, China and other outsiders) should not so much as think of \"meddling\" in the Western Hemisphere, where the Americans are the chief decision-makers, the instinctive pride of countries in the region, pride for their independence and what has been achieved by the Latin American and Caribbean nations since independence, should probably snap into action. Russia has never used friendships as a hostile tool, be it in Latin America or anywhere else. Regrettably, our US colleagues believe they have a license to do just about anything, and so they are likely to stir up all their dialogue partners against China and most certainly against Russia. But these are clearly wrong methods whereby to gain international prestige. International prestige is earned through one's own example and power of persuasion rather than gross blackmail, diktat, or sanctions. But so far I see nothing else in the arsenal of US diplomacy.  Is the Trump presidency a threat to world peace? We are doing our best so that the great powers, including Russia and the US, become aware of their responsibility for not allowing a global conflict to flare up. About a year and a half ago, we suggested that the United States reiterate what the USSR and the US said in the previous epoch marked by the end of the Cold War, when General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan signed a statement to the effect that a nuclear war cannot be won, there can be no winners in such a war, and therefore it must never be unleashed. One and a half years ago, to placate the world public opinion, we urged the United States to reiterate verbatim what had already been said by our two countries in that era. The proposal is still \"on the table.\" Washington has promised to reply soon. Hopefully the answer will be in the affirmative.

We still have differences on an entire range of issues, but dialogue must continue. We are ready to cooperate to the same degree as you are. Last year Prime Minister of Sweden Stefan Lofven visited St Petersburg to take part in an Arctic event and met with President of Russia Vladimir Putin. This gave a boost to resuming our contacts.

Contacts between various Russian and Swedish agency heads were also being established or resuming. This is also beneficial. We appreciated that Prime Minister of Sweden Stefan Lofven sent his greetings to the new Prime Minister of Russia, Mikhail Mishustin. In his message, he stressed Sweden's determination to develop cooperation in areas of mutual interest. We share this approach. There are many plans for various areas of bilateral relations. I hope that today we will discuss them in detail, as well as international and regional issues, above all, security in Europe and in the Baltic region. Welcome.

We are absolutely committed to the agreements that were reached during Russian President Vladimir Putin's meeting with President of the Republic of Cuba Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez in Moscow in October 2019. These agreements primarily concern improving the mechanisms of economic cooperation, especially in the context of the illegitimate sanctions that the United States continues to increase. All these matters will be substantively considered during the planned meeting of the Russian-Cuban Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Research and Technical Cooperation in Moscow. It will focus on steps that must be agreed upon for the practical implementation of the cooperation programme in fuel and energy. Our top-level contacts will certainly continue this year. We are expecting Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez to attend the events in Moscow to mark the 75th anniversary of Victory in WWII and the 60th anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic relations. High Cuban delegations have also confirmed that they will be taking part in a number of other events due in the next few months, including the Moscow Conference on International Security, the St Petersburg International Legal Forum, the St Petersburg International Economic Forum and other occasions. Russian delegations, in turn, will participate in the upcoming University 2020 international educational forum in Havana.

{"Title": "Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's statement and answers to questions at a news conference following talks with Foreign Minister of Sweden Ann Linde, Moscow, February 4, 2020", "articleID": "4021383", "article_URL": "https://www.mid.ru/en/press_service/minister_speeches/-/asset_publisher/7OvQR5KJWVmR/content/id/4021383", "ArticleText": "Toggle navigation      / / Asset Publisher 4 February 2020 190-04-02-2020 Ladies and gentlemen, We had constructive talks and reviewed bilateral relations and cooperation on international and regional affairs as a follow-up to President Putin's meeting with Prime Minister of Sweden Stefan Lofven in April 2019. We reaffirmed our mutual commitment to promote practical cooperation and welcomed progress in economic cooperation. About 500 Swedish companies are operating in Russia, and they plan to continue in the future. Overall Swedish investment in the Russian economy was about $5 billion in 2019. Last year, trade was down slightly, but we share the opinion that this trend is easily reversible, and the Russian-Swedish Supervisory Committee on Trade and Economic Cooperation could play an important role in making this happen. Recently, the co-chairs of this important body have been in touch on a regular basis, but no plenary meeting has been held since 2013. We think it is time to hold this meeting. The St Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) is a useful platform as well. Our Swedish colleagues, including Swedish government members, regularly participate. Last year, Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Ann Linde led the Swedish delegation in her capacity as Minister for Foreign Trade. We share the belief that cultural ties, including education, scientific research and personal contacts in general are important. We believe that contact between our respective parliament members, which have not been too active so far, could contribute to this as well. We spoke in detail about the importance of cooperation in regional formats such as the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS), the Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC) and the Arctic Council and have come to understand that we are on the same page regarding these matters. We exchanged views on the security situation in the Baltic Sea region in detail. We apprised our partners of our concern about NATO's rather provocative actions, which is increasing its military activity and presence near Russia's borders. Russia does not see a single problem either in the Baltic Sea or the north in general that would need a military solution. We mentioned Russia's recent initiatives aimed at reducing tension and strengthening mutual trust, including in the military area. In this context, Russia considers Sweden's traditional non-alignment policy to be an important factor in maintaining stability in northern Europe. We touched on relations between Russia and the EU, as well as OSCE activities, primarily in the context of Sweden's upcoming chairmanship in this organisation in 2021. We proposed holding consultations on the OSCE agenda, including the Ukraine settlement, in which the OSCE is playing a very positive role, and we would like to make this role even more important. Clearly, a settlement can only be achieved if it is based on the Minsk Package of Measures, which implies a face-to-face dialogue between Kiev, Donetsk and Lugansk. In this respect, today we touched on the results of the Normandy format summit recently held in Paris and the tasks for the Contact Group arising from it. Of mutual interest to our countries are issues relating to the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, including the crises in Syria and Libya, the situation in the Persian Gulf and, of course, the situation around the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran's nuclear programme. We are open to substantive consultations with our Swedish colleagues on all the above and any other matters that will foster mutual understanding.     I would like to thank once again Ms Ann Linde and her delegation for the substantive talks. Do you believe Russia and Sweden stand a chance of getting back to truly good relations, given the difficulties that have emerged in recent years due to the serious difference of opinion on the Ukraine issue? We see no obstacles to normalising relations. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, there are disagreements but they should not impede cooperation. It is now clear to everyone that the European Union has driven itself into a corner when several years ago it approved the so-called Five Principles, which tie the full normalisation of relations with Russia to the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. Not only has the European Union reconciled with the anti-constitutional coup in Ukraine that was carried out by ultra-[nationalist] radicals in February 2014 but it has recognised the coup. The European Union failed to comment in any way on the first action by the putschists, who decided to strip the Russian language of its special status and talked about annihilating Russians or forcing them out of Crimea. The European Union tacitly agreed to all this. The EU supported the war that the coupists launched against their own people in the east of Ukraine because the latter refused to accept the coup and asked to be left alone so they could figure out what was going on. I will tell you straight that we had a hard time trying to persuade the people in Donbass to join the talks in the Normandy format, which eventually produced the Minsk Agreements that were endorsed by the UN Security Council. Nevertheless, for four years the Poroshenko regime did nothing to implement the document that has no alternative. Despite the hysterics of the neo-Nazis, President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky found the strength to start carrying out Kiev's commitments. The first steps on the disengagement of forces and hardware were made, and Frank-Walter Steinmeier's formula on the link between the elections in Donbass and the granting of a special status to this region was put on paper. This made it possible to hold a third Normandy summit in Paris in December 2019. Ms Minister mentioned this fact and the need to implement the commitments agreed upon. The authorities in Kiev assumed a number of commitments. Under the Minsk Agreements, they committed to permanently include the special status of Donbass in Ukrainian legislation. The only way to do this is to reflect this special status in the Ukrainian constitution. The second commitment that Kiev assumed during talks with Donetsk and Lugansk via the Contact Group was the disengagement of forces and hadware in three new sections. But it should be recalled at this point that in Paris, Russia, France and Germany were ready to support the approach adopted earlier, notably on the disengagement of forces and weapons all along the contact line rather than just three sections. Regrettably, to the surprise of the other parties, President Zelensky and his delegation were unable to take this step, which would be fully in line with the Minsk Agreements. Therefore, the answer to the question of how to overcome the current situation is as follows: it is necessary to fully and consistently carry out the Minsk Agreements, which requires specific moves by Kiev, Donetsk and Lugansk. I probably tired you out with this. I apologise for discussing your question in such detail, but it seems to me that the way you put it revealed a serious lack of information on the history of this issue. As for Crimea, this is even easier to explain. It is simply necessary to respect the will expressed by the Crimean people. Those who would like to make sure this will was absolutely sincere should simply go to Crimea. The opportunity is there, and many people are taking it. We are happy to welcome any unbiased people to this region of Russia who want to see how the peoples in this republic live.  The Swedish Defence Committee stated that Russia is a threat to Sweden. It did not even rule out the possibility of an attack. Did you discuss these issues during today's meeting? Did you manage to remove at least part of this concern? We discussed this today. The threats and risks are mounting. We exchanged our views on NATO's unprecedented plans to move towards our borders and involve neutral countries (like Sweden and Finland) in its military exercises. We suggested to our Swedish neighbours that we develop a trust-based and open dialogue between our militaries like we did with Finland three years ago. Our Swedish colleagues promised to consider this proposal. I hope we will continue this conversation. We are ready to discuss any issue with our partners in an absolutely open manner.                  Advanced settings         Switcher      6 Photos close"},

I'm happy to be here today at an event that is being held as part of opening an MGIMO University branch in the capital of Uzbekistan. I'm pleased to speak before the students and the faculty led by our university graduate Mr Islamov. Clearly, opening an MGIMO University branch is an important step in our foreign policy cooperation in the sphere of education and coordination of our actions. It also reflects the growing interest in the Russian language and education, which is actively supported by President Mirziyoyev. As far as I understand, you now have eight branches of Russian universities in Uzbekistan. This is not the final number. Today, during our conversation, President Mirziyoyev said there are plans to open several more branches of Russian universities. We will do our utmost to cooperate in these endeavours. Last year, MGIMO University marked its 75  anniversary. Over the past three quarters of a century, it has come a long way and become a truly unique research and training school. I'm confident that you will carry on the glorious traditions of training highly qualified specialists in international affairs in a wide range of areas, primarily, of course, the diplomatic service, but not only it, because MGIMO University graduates are in demand in other public services and private businesses. The efforts to train such specialists are all the more in demand, as the importance of diplomacy and the ability to negotiate has increased many times over. I would like to note that tectonic processes are underway in the modern world that are associated with the ongoing redistribution of the global balance of forces and the formation of a fundamentally new, more democratic and pluralistic, multipolar international order. New centres of economic growth, financial power and political influence are emerging in the Asia-Pacific Region, Latin America and Africa, which many refer to as the continent of the future, the potential of which remains untapped. I'm confident that this historical era will last a long time, but this is an objective process, and it can't be stopped. Western countries - the historical West, as they say - have been dominating in the world perhaps for at least five hundred years. This era is now receding in the past. It is time to share power and influence and to make agreements with new strong players. Unfortunately, our Western colleagues are trying to torpedo these processes and hold on to their position of power, but life makes them act according to the objective trends of global development instead of based on unilateral geopolitical attitudes. Today, alongside these processes and the need to develop relevant forms of interaction and cooperation, the demand for a completely new level of trust and coordination among all these leading international players is growing in order to face the serious challenges and threats that cross borders today. There is no way to hide from them behind national borders. Terrorism, drug trafficking and other forms of organised crime, as well as cybercrime, which today requires new non-standard approaches to prevent it from causing huge damage to all the countries in the world, are among the most terrible threats. I do not even mention such a traditional issue as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. By the way, climate change is another one of these threats and risks. They can only be addressed together under the umbrella of the United Nations, on the firm ground of its Charter and other universally applied norms of international law. Organisations of which Russia and Uzbekistan are members operate on the grounds of mutual respect, equality, the search for a balance of interests, compromise and consensus such as the CIS and the SCO. Russia's work at BRICS and in the Russia - India - China format, which we abbreviate as RIC, is also based on these principles. I would also like to mention the G20, the establishment of which several years ago as well as the creation of the mechanism of its summits reflect the West's growing understanding of the need to abandon its dictate in the world economy and to come to terms with the new centres of power. As you know, the G20 includes the G7, which until recently tried to govern the global economic and financial processes alone, BRICS countries and a range of rapidly growing economies of the developing world, which share the vision of the BRICS on principal issues. Without doubt, the G20 is turning into a forum for political discussions, which allows large powerful countries that are not members of the UN Security Council to get involved. Of course, it is clear that political coordination needs to improve, given that reckless - let's call a spade a spade - actions by our American partners and  their closest allies, unfortunately, led to disastrous consequences in the Middle East. Iraq was destroyed, and is now struggling to restore its integrity and ability to bring life in the country back to normal. Libya was also destroyed, and they have a long way to go before rebuilding their statehood. An attempt was made to do the same in Syria. However, this time, responding to the request from the legitimate government of the Syrian Arab Republic, the Russian Federation provided, I believe, very effective assistance to the Syrian people in warding off the threat posed by global terrorism and the Syrian people have repelled it. Some less significant challenges facing the country have yet to be addressed. We helped the Syrian people to defend the statehood of their country. I believe this should serve in the future as a good example of how to prevent this sort of aggressive and reckless attempts to decide the fate of whole regions from overseas or any other place on Earth, for that matter. The situation around Iran is doing much harm to strategic stability as it has evolved into a crisis after the US unilateral arbitrary pullout of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran's nuclear programme and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (the INF Treaty) - a pullout which is, essentially, responsible for dismantling this very important agreement on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, as well as for giving rise to tensions in the context of arms control, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the limitation of arms, primarily, nuclear weapons. We are also seeing ongoing attempts to use unfair methods of competition - now we move to the economy. Washington is still trying to impose American approaches outside the G20 and the World Trade Organisation formats.  It is impeding the WTO activities as the WTO mechanism for settling disputes cannot function properly because of the US position. Meanwhile our American colleagues are trying to push through on a bilateral basis their decisions on how to resolve global problems, having no scruples in actively resorting to protectionism and unilateral unlawful economic sanctions, openly abusing the status of the dollar. It seems to me that these methods of waging trade and other wars, including hot wars, have no prospects in the future. Rather these will be methods of building cooperation while abstaining from dictating others, as well as threats and zero-sum games. As I said before, we need to promote the value of dialogue, consensus and mutual respect. Only in this way can we move along the road to resolving global issues based on truly sustainable decisions, instead of short-term ones that are geared to some domestic political events or electoral cycles. We are now introducing multilateral diplomacy formats such as the Astana process. Russia, Turkey and Iran are actively involved in resolving the Syria crisis, not only in terms of stabilising the situation on the ground but launching the political process as well. The Constitutional Committee became operational. This is an ongoing effort. It is no accident that the Astana process has drawn the attention of other countries as well, with Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon having an observer status in this multilateral format. Moreover, when we address the Syrian, Libyan or any other international issue, we never force anyone to do anything against their will and never impose anything on anyone. We are pursuing a foreign policy that promotes pragmatism and realistic solutions rather than putting forward high-profile initiatives designed to produce an immediate propaganda effect, but which contain zero specific steps to bring a solution to a particular problem. Our initiatives aim to unite the efforts and capabilities of various states. For example, an initiative to form the Greater Eurasian Partnership, which President Vladimir Putin put forward during the Russia-ASEAN Summit in May 2016, serves this purpose. This partnership is supposed to combine the capabilities of the EAEU, the SCO and ASEAN member countries. Similarly, we propose adopting collective approaches to agreeing upon general principles for promoting non-proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. There are many challenges in this area that are related to our Western colleagues' attempts to steamroll the verification procedures for themselves and their unwillingness to transparently consider the problems in these areas. Of course, like any other responsible country, we want to have a friendly external environment and neighbourly relations and to maintain constructive interaction with all our foreign partners without exception in all formats around the world with the understanding that our colleagues are willing to reciprocate. So, we note with satisfaction that Russia and the Central Asian countries are linked by alliance and strategic partnership based on the principles of international law, respect and consideration for each other's interests, as well as the search for a balance of interests when considering any issues. This, of course, fully applies to our alliance and strategic partnership with Uzbekistan. Our trade is steadily growing, and our leaders have set the goal to reach the level of $10 billion. So far, we have reached about half this amount. Upcoming events, including a meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission on Economic Cooperation, will be used to outline concrete steps to implement the tasks set by the presidents. We have ambitious joint projects ranging from energy, including nuclear, to engineering. The total volume of Russia's investment in the economy of Uzbekistan exceeds $9 billion, with over 1,700 enterprises with the Russian capital operating in Uzbekistan. We work closely at various multilateral venues, including the UN and the CIS, which Uzbekistan is currently chairing, and the SCO. These links are deep and effective. We believe the CIS fully serves its purpose as a structure in the post-Soviet space where all new states may discuss any arising questions. I think the full unifying potential of the Commonwealth has not yet been unlocked. We share the priorities of Uzbekistan's CIS presidency this year and are ready to do everything we can to help implement them.  We consider important our joint work in the SCO and support active cooperation between Uzbekistan, on the one hand, and the EAEU and CSTO, on the other. I discussed this today with President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev and my counterpart, Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov. The Eurasian Economic Union is developing fairly quickly and successfully. Common markets of goods, services, capital and workforce have been created.  International contacts with third countries are growing. Free trade agreements have been signed with Vietnam, Singapore and Serbia. Contracts with Iran and China have been signed. Talks are underway with Israel, Egypt and many other countries including Latin American states, as well as with international integration associations, including ASEAN. Ties between the SCO and the EAEU are growing stronger.     We are conducting useful dialogue with our Uzbek friends on the best ways to develop practical cooperation with the EAEU. Friends, This year we are celebrating the 75  anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War. Our peoples fought against Nazism shoulder to shoulder and together with other Soviet nations made a decisive contribution to the liberation of Europe and the rest of the world from the Nazi horrors. The victory laid the foundations of the modern international security system, including the establishment of the United Nations. The principles of its Charter are immutable. For all of their novelties, any reforms of international organisations and relations, which will be numerous, must by all mean rely on these principles that have universal value and are recognised by all countries without exception. We must cherish the memory of the exploits of our fathers and grandfathers and must not allow anyone to rewrite history, call into doubt the results of World War II, or justify the crimes of the Nazis and their accomplices. Of course, attempts to revise the decisions of the Nuremberg Trials are unacceptable. We are witnessing such fairly active attempts in several countries, and regrettably, in European Union states that are continuously presenting themselves as a model of democracy. This is a very dangerous trend and must be countered. We are looking forward to the arrival of our dear friends for the celebrations of the 75  anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War on May 9, 2020. Naturally, we are looking forward to the arrival of our friends from Uzbekistan. I am confident that this great holiday will be observed in Moscow, Tashkent and other cities of our two countries. I know that the Park of Victory is being restored in Tashkent, and I hope that we will have an opportunity to take part in its opening ceremony.      In conclusion, I would like to wish students success in their studies. You will ensure the continuity of our foreign policy cooperation, primarily the foreign policy course of your state. I hope you will take part in forming and developing the agenda for cooperation between Russia and Uzbekistan. I hope the knowledge and skills that you will receive at this MGIMO branch will help you in all your undertakings.     Thank you very much. I am ready to answer your questions. We are studying economics, and we have even tried to apply systems modelling to it. But the range of multilateral organisations that are open to Uzbekistan make this foreign economic model extremely complicated. Which multilateral organisations, integration mechanisms and regional agreements could be most effective for creating this model and for the success of Russia-Uzbekistan relations? I hope our choice is not limited to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)? In principle, the economy is the basis for everything else. As you know, social being determines consciousness. Each country must make its own choice depending on its understanding of national interests, development goals and the form of development that will help it enhance the living standards. You can share your experience and solutions, but the choice ultimately rests with the government of sovereign states. As I said, we maintain an intensive dialogue on economic matters. Our bilateral ties have been developing very rapidly and effectively in the past few years in accordance with the decisions taken by President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev. As for multilateral formats, these include first of all the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which has a free trade zone. Russia and Uzbekistan are working fruitfully within the CIS. We welcome the increase in Tashkent's involvement in the CIS over the past few years. Uzbekistan holds the CIS presidency this year. By the way, the latest CIS summit held in Ashgabat in October 2019 adopted the Declaration on Strategic Economic Cooperation. This shows that new goals can be set at the CIS and attained in a more efficient manner if undertaken collectively, which is proof that serious attention is being given to the economy within the organisation. I have already mentioned the free trade zone. As for the EAEU, it is also a form of dialogue. Uzbekistan is pondering the forms of interaction with the EAEU, especially since the establishment of the system of observer countries more than 18 months ago. Overall, the EAEU is a massive organisation with a combined population of 182 million, a common market of capital, goods, services and workforce, as well as a collective GDP of approximately $2.2 trillion. It is an impressive indicator as well. The development logic at the EAEU was the same as in many other associations around the world, including the European Union. First we created a free trade zone and then proceeded to the Customs Union of Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus, ultimately creating the EAEU, which Kyrgyzstan and Armenia joined as member countries. I have mentioned the EAEU's foreign relations, which are extensive. I believe that Uzbekistan will be able to see its prospects in this association during the ongoing consultations, in which Russia is actively involved.  President Vladimir Putin yesterday proposed changing the fundamental law to directly guarantee the priority of the Russian Constitution in the international legal framework. Does this mean that Russia will follow in the footsteps of the United States, where the priority of national law is being implemented most fully? There are many examples when the Americans disregard international conventions and court decisions. Could this lead to Russia's withdrawal from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)? The Russian Constitutional Court has issued an explanation according to which the provisions of the Russian Constitution prevail over everything else. This is not a unique situation. Some Western countries, in particular Germany and Britain, have such provisions as well. The United States interprets international law as a matter of little importance, and this is how the Americans have regarded it. I would like to note that a country only assumes international obligations after ratifying agreements or treaties. Ratification must be formalised in a federal law. Laws must not contradict the Constitution. There is no contradiction here. We are committed to all of our obligations under the documents which we sign voluntarily and which our Parliament, made up of representatives of the people, ratify, making these documents part of our legal framework.  All of us realise that Russia and Uzbekistan need each other. The term \"strategic partnership\" describes our partnership.  What three main components of the strategic partnership can you name in this Russian-Uzbek union?  We are both strategic partners and allies. In 2005, our countries signed the Treaty on Allied Relations. This document remains in force and is a pillar of our collaboration. All agencies, including economic agencies, defence ministries, the Security Council, law enforcement agencies and secret services, maintain very close ties. We address many tasks while maintaining the security of Uzbekistan and the whole of Central Asia where the threat of terrorism and illegal drug trafficking is quite serious. We have reached large-scale agreements in the area of modernising the Armed Forces of the Republic of Uzbekistan and reequipping them with modern Russian weapons. Military-technical cooperation continues to develop very well. I believe that the security sphere is among the main and most tangible aspects. The economy is the second no less outstanding direction. I have dwelled on this in great detail. Mutual investment volumes continue to expand, and we are adopting additional decisions allowing Russian and Uzbek companies to trade under easy-term plans and to reduce material and temporal outlays. I believe that we have a rather packed programme of economic cooperation that, with due consideration for new tasks, will be discussed in great detail during preparations for the state visit to the Russian Federation by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, scheduled for this year. We are preparing a meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission on Economic Cooperation. On the whole, we are discussing dozens of major aspects to further expand our collaboration. I would also like to mention cultural and humanitarian cooperation. I have already touched upon the fact that the people of Uzbekistan are highly interested in the Russian language and Russian-language education. We appreciate this very much. We appreciate the fact that Uzbekistan ranks among the countries contributing the greatest number of students to Russian higher education institutions. Over 29,000 students from Uzbekistan study in Russia, including over 6,000 at federal-budget expense. President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev has asked us to increase the number of scholarships which we provide each year. Most likely, we will support this request. We will see to it that the request materialises into specific decisions in the near future. Apart from security, the economy, cultural and humanitarian collaboration, it would be wrong not to mention the fourth area, namely, foreign policy coordination. We voice common positions on an overwhelming majority of matters regarding the international and regional agenda. This is manifested most vividly on the Afghan track where Russia and Uzbekistan act hand in hand. They perceive national reconciliation and the creation of favourable conditions that would allow all ethnic, political and social groups, as well as religious denominations, to feel comfortable in Afghanistan as the only goal that can pacify the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Only the people of Afghanistan themselves can accomplish this. All the initiatives by Tashkent and Moscow are aimed at creating favourable conditions, which will allow the people of Afghanistan themselves to reach agreement without any external advice. The range of our relations is sufficiently diverse. I repeat, they are allied and strategic in real life, rather than on paper.  You are paying an official visit to Uzbekistan as Acting Foreign Minister of Russia. What position can you assume in the future?  Are you a journalist? You should enrol at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO). All these years, immediately after graduation, I always honestly discharged my duties, instead of merely holding any positions. I continue to do this today.  Today you had a meeting with President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev. Have you mentioned Uzbekistan joining the EAEU? If so, what will the criteria be, and will it happen immediately or gradually?  I have already mentioned that the decision should be made by the country itself that wants to somehow diversify its external economic contacts and is using various formats. We, as friends, strategic partners, and allies at the level of governments and deputy prime ministers, are discussing in a very specific, substantive dialogue how the EAEU can interact with Uzbekistan. We are providing information and giving assessments, but the decision, of course, will be made by the President and the Parliament of Uzbekistan. This is the framework in which Shavkat Mirziyoyev and I have discussed it today.  What have you agreed on? Get a degree from MGIMO.  You probably know how widespread the topic of artificial intelligence is in the modern world. It is even supposed to be used in international affairs, to analyse socioeconomic processes, and in modern politics. Can you comment on this?  Modern technologies are definitely of great help in both studying and working, primarily in terms of quickly gathering information from various sources, and the ability to compare facts. Now that life is changing so rapidly (this has never happened before, including in the international arena), it is important to have information, to know how to obtain it and use the facts derived from access to information. In this sense, all areas of life are now being revolutionised. No wonder digitalisation of the economy has become the watchword in all countries, including Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said that the players who possess modern technology to the greatest extent will have the strongest position on the world stage. Speaking specifically about diplomacy, in addition to the unconditional advantage that I mentioned (quick access to reliable information from different sources and the ability to compare it), probably neither artificial intelligence, nor anything else can replace a diplomat as a person. With all the scope for saturating your memory with knowledge, and the ability to simulate the development of a particular crisis, to reach a solution it is crucial to sit down with a person or several people that matter, look each other in the eye and start just discussing the interests of the parties involved and trying to find a balance between these interests. No machine will ever be able to replace face-to-face contacts. Diplomacy is the ability to negotiate. You can't reach agreement with a machine - it is a cold tool. A machine can beat anyone in chess. This is a highly intellectual game, but all the moves are prescribed, so all you can do is change their order, invent new methods of defence or attack. The game has rules that never change. In diplomacy, situations may arise that only a living creature with a natural, human intellect can identify and resolve. What is the structure of the Russian Foreign Ministry? It is available on our online resources, on our website. We have recently established a new, 42nd department, which will deal with cyber threats. It is the Department of International Information Security. We have some 3,500 employees. Some departments deal with regional affairs, including four European departments, one North American and one Latin American department, four Asian departments, as well as one African and one Middle East department. Some departments are not concerned with regional affairs but with a particular function, such as the UN and the OSCE, or relations with NATO and the EU. We have four really important CIS departments, one that deals with CIS affairs and other multilateral organisations in the post-Soviet space, including the EAEU and the CSTO, plus the CIS departments that are in charge of European, Central Asian and South Caucasian affairs.  You have said today that Russia will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. How will the Foreign Ministry contribute to this? The Russian Foreign Ministry is directly involved in the events held to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War. Personally, I am a member of the Organising Committee for Celebrations of the 75th Anniversary of Victory. We plan to celebrate this event in every country, but especially in the countries where WWII battles took place, when our soldiers liberated Europe. We are holding a series of events involving the maintenance of monuments, memorials and graves in cooperation with the host countries. These events have attracted public attention and active support in the overwhelming majority of states. Attempts have been made in some countries, primarily in the Baltics, to subdue the memory of the war and the great sacrifices it involved, primarily among young people. This is a different part of our work. It calls for daily efforts to attract the attention of international organisations to the importance of compliance with the provisions of the UN Charter and respect for the decisions of the Nuremberg Trials. This is what our diplomats are doing. We have submitted an initiative to hold a special UN General Assembly session in May this year. Uzbekistan co-authored that initiative. We have also proposed holding a special event and adopting a declaration of the 75th anniversary of Victory at the OSCE. There are many more events involved, which together comprise a key priority sphere of our operation this year.  We know that you made the acquaintance of many students from other countries, including Uzbekistan, at MGIMO, and that you interacted with many of them after graduation. Do Uzbek graduates have any special character traits? Do these traits have any influence on Uzbekistani diplomacy?  Every ethnic group and nation has specific features. I studied together and remain friends with many citizens of Uzbekistan who have become business and diplomatic leaders. I will not name them here so as not to offend anyone by not naming them. All MGIMO graduates regardless of their nationality and origin must be, above all, professionals committed to their countries. The most important thing is for the knowledge you receive to be used for the benefit of your people and your country and for strengthening its positions on the international stage, including when it comes to defence, the economy and culture. I believe that Uzbekistan, whose culture dates back hundreds if not thousands of years, has very many talented people who will be able to effectively attain these goals if they receive a good education.  There are many interpretations of international law. Some believe that this area continues to develop dynamically, and others claim that it obviously lags behind the requirements of modern life. What is your perception of modern international law?  To put it simply, international law always lags behind international life because it is necessary to formalise and coordinate it. International law should be universally acceptable in order to become effective. As a rule, this implies conventions that are the subject of lengthy talks sometimes lasting many years. The concerned parties sign and ratify them. Conventions aim to respond to certain real-life events. For example, this concerns cybersecurity and cybercrime. Today, hackers steal money, cheat with card accounts and use cyberspace to undermine the functioning of vital infrastructure systems ensuring the operation of the energy sector and other areas. So far, there is no tool to combat this threat. We submitted a proposal to the UN sufficiently long ago (several years ago), and they approved it. The proposal was submitted following its coordination by SCO countries, including with the involvement of Uzbekistan, so as to draft generally acceptable rules for the responsible conduct of states in media space that would be universally interpreted and applied. Expert groups were established several times; and each of them took a short step forward. A working group has been established in which all UN member countries are currently involved. We have submitted the draft rules of responsible conduct to its members for consideration. Here is a classic example. In the United Kingdom, when they want to build a path across a lawn, they first allow people to walk on it. Stones will be placed where they have trampled a path. One can say just about the same about international law. First, it is necessary to understand in what direction we might find an international-law tool. Of course, it is necessary to fulfil a convention after it has received international-law status, has been ratified by all states and has acquired mandatory status for them. The main problem is that various parties, including our American colleagues, are now freely and boldly handling and interpreting international law. We have noted this today, while replying to a question by a Kommersant correspondent. Please note, this is a very interesting thing, and I discussed it in India yesterday at a plenary meeting of the multilateral conference Raisina Dialogue. I noted that our Western colleagues were using the expression \"international law\" less often. They have already started talking differently and urging everyone to comply with, honour and fulfil rules on which the international order hinges. No generally accepted document formalises this non-legal term. When we ask about the difference, they reply that the difference is that it is necessary to abide by rules on which the international order is based. And what are these rules? Does this amount to international law? If this is so, then why do we have to invent something? In real life, for example, we have the ratified Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (more than 190 states committed to it). The West did not like the fact that we caught the OPCW Technical Secretariat juggling around with the facts, in particular when it was investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria. We literally caught them manipulating the facts and we demanded that their behaviour should change and that they stop putting the blame on just any party, in this case, on Syria. Instead of dealing transparently and collectively with this, the West, by voting, pushed the decision to give the OPCW Technical Secretariat the right to name the perpetrators (although under the CWC, its only function is to respond to a party's request to establish whether a prohibited substance was used by sending an inspector). Everything else is up to the UN Security Council. Despite the minority of votes (86 versus more than 100 votes of the participating countries) they have pushed the decision through that undermines the Convention. Now the OPCW Secretariat is trying in every possible way to evade being transparent about how it is implementing the Convention. Now roughly the same is happening with the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Biological and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction (BTWC). The Americans refuse to create a multilateral, universal mechanism for verifying the implementation of this document, which would be understandable and transparent for everyone. They are trying to deal with all matters through closed-door, secretive bilateral contacts and agreements with individual countries; they are especially active in the post-Soviet space. We have signed a memorandum with Uzbekistan on closely cooperating in the field of biosafety and on the promotion of our common interests. Take the Middle East peace process. There is an international law in the form of a UN Security Council resolution on the need to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. This is an international law. But our American colleagues said that they will have their own rules. And those rules would lead to a 'deal of the century,' something the Americans have been promising for four years now but no one has seen yet. Meanwhile, they have recognised the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights as legitimate, as well as moving their embassy to Jerusalem, and said that the illegal Israeli settlements on the West Bank, established against the UN Security Council requirements, are now legitimate for the United States. So this is how it works, there is international law - and there are rules. I have mentioned the WTO. The United States has simply blocked the dispute resolution mechanism through procedural tricks. When someone becomes concerned that the Americans are dishonest on the global markets, with trade deals or whatever, there is nowhere to complain to. So the Americans use this situation to offer bilateral channels, using threats, ultimatums and other pressure tools, trying to push their interests to the detriment of the interests of others. We must respect international laws, I mean everyone. This is a serious matter for the international agenda.                  Advanced settings         Switcher      6 Photos close"},
{"Title": "Acting Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's statement for the media on the outcome of the Berlin Conference on Libya, Berlin, January 19, 2020", "articleID": "4001846", "article_URL": "https://www.mid.ru/en/press_service/minister_speeches/-/asset_publisher/7OvQR5KJWVmR/content/id/4001846", "ArticleText": "Toggle navigation      / / Asset Publisher 19 January 2020 72-19-01-2020 The Berlin Conference on Libya, which lasted about five hours, is over. It took rather long, about four months, to prepare it. It was preceded by five rounds of consultations at the level of senior officials. This resulted in the preparation of a detailed document that contains recommendations on ways to overcome the ongoing Libyan crisis. This document is divided into chapters, one of which has to do with efforts in the sphere of security and stipulates measures for attaining a lasting ceasefire. There is also a chapter on the political process and one on settling Libya's economic problems so as to ensure that all its religious, ethnic and political groups have access to the country's natural wealth. There is also a chapter on humanitarian problems and human rights, as well as on the support which the international community led by the United Nations (UN) should give to all of these processes. Russia was involved in these preparations from the very beginning. We attended all the five preparatory rounds. It was at our insistence that the conference organisers abandoned their initial idea of meeting without the Libyan parties. Invitations to the conference were sent to the Libyan leaders - Prime Minister of the Government of National Accord Fayez Mustafa al-Sarraj and Commander of the Libyan National Army Marshal Khalifa Haftar. It was at our initiative as well that the range of participants from among Libya's neighbours was expanded, because their interests must be protected and their views are extremely important for lasting agreements. The third element on which we insisted was that the conference documents reproduce, clearly and unambiguously, the key provisions of the UN Security Council resolutions on Libya, primarily the provisions on the absence of a military solution and the importance of achieving a settlement through the efforts of the Libyans themselves without any foreign interference. We managed to formulate the final statement of the conference so that all the practical recommendations and proposals that should be adopted have been approved by the Libyan parties. Of course, the document emphasised the role of the UN Security Council, to which the document will be submitted for analysis, consideration and approval. President of Russia Vladimir Putin put forth our position and pointed out that the Libyans' opinion would be taken into account when the Berlin conference's recommendations were discussed at the UN Security Council. This opinion should be expressed clearly before the UN Security Council starts working on the document. The situation is difficult. The Libyan parties have made a small step forward since the January 13 meeting held in Moscow. They have agreed to send five delegates each to a military committee that will be established at the UN's initiative to discuss all issues related to the ceasefire. As you know, the ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey took effect after midnight on January 12. Today we agreed that the ceasefire was largely respected, although there have been violations on both sides. The countries that can influence the situation on the ground in Libya pledged today to abstain from any steps that could provoke the Libyan parties into resuming full-scale hostilities, and said that they would encourage compliance with and consolidation and strengthening of the ceasefire. The military committee comprising five representatives each of Fayez al-Sarraj and Khalifa Haftar will work under UN supervision to coordinate practical confidence-building measures for a more permanent ceasefire. Overall, we believe that the conference was very useful. It is clear that the final decision will be made by the Libyans themselves. And it is clear that a serious and sustainable dialogue between the Libyan parties is so far impossible because of the vast differences between them. At the same time, the recommendations and proposals sealed in the final document of the Berlin conference will complement the list of international initiatives aimed at encouraging the Libyan parties to coordinate the conditions for launching talks and reaching agreements.

We are confident that your rich political and government experience in all of your previous positions, including the head of the Belarus Security Council, will make your work more effective. On our part, we promise to support you in all of your endeavours and the actions of your Secretariat to implement the decisions made by the heads of state and other charter bodies of the CSTO. I am very glad to meet with you and would like to once again congratulate you on your appointment. *** The proposals of President of Russia Vladimir Putin, who has assumed the CSTO presidency for this year, were supported in Bishkek. I think it would be absolutely right to start preparing practical measures on all of these issues now. *** The celebrations of the 75  anniversary of Victory are playing the main role in the initiatives and priorities of the Russian presidency. Apart from the political, memorial, purely military and information components, this event has a legal element because there are attempts to call into question the legal results of World War II. Vladimir Putin made several statements in this regard. President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko also regularly emphasises that rewriting history is unacceptable. I am convinced that all CSTO countries agree on this, as our joint work shows. We will do our best to assist you in all areas of your activities that are authorised by heads of state. We will discuss this in more detail today.                  Advanced settings         Switcher      6 Photos close"},

Last quarter, we met to discuss the development of interregional cooperation and interregional forums and conferences. Work in this sphere has proceeded energetically with due regard for the recommendations adopted at the meeting and subsequently approved by President of Russia Vladimir Putin. In some cases, the format of interregional meetings provides for the personal attendance by the heads of state. This is proof of the attention our work is being given at the top level. The range of subjects we address is expanding and includes now not only trade and the economy, which is what we began with, but also culture, humanitarian matters, education and sports, as well as events held to promote people-to-people contacts. Allocations for holding such events are increasing, including from the federal budget. Our interaction includes efforts to further expand the geography of our cooperation. Proposals on establishing interregional platforms are being discussed by our colleagues in Iran, Greece and India. This spring, we are planning to hold a large-scale meeting of representatives of Russian and Moldovan regions. Agreements have been reached to hold a Russian-French year of interregional cooperation in 2020. Similar events were held recently with our German colleagues. We can report positive achievements in the sphere of international associations. The EAEU plans include economic events to be attended by representatives from the member states' regions. A Forum of the Heads of Regions of the SCO member states is being established at Russia's initiative and in accordance with the Plan of Events for Russia's SCO presidency approved by President Putin. The first meeting of the new forum is scheduled to take place in May this year. The involvement of Russian regions in the activities of interregional platforms meets their development plans and helps to promote a positive international agenda. We will continue to cooperate with and provide all-round support to the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. Today we will be discussing inter-municipal cooperation, which is not unlike interregional cooperation. The development of inter-municipal cooperation is having a positive effect on trade and tourism and is promoting research, educational and cultural relations and people-to-people ties. Good results have been achieved in this sphere of late. Last year, Ryazan hosted the first Russia-China Municipal Forum, which was attended by 70 Chinese delegates and over 80 Russian representatives. Sister relations have been established between 44 municipal and administrative territories in Russia and South Korea, plus 26 Russian and 32 Japanese municipalities are involved in the Russia-Japan inter-municipal cooperation. The first Russian-US Municipal Forum was held in Moscow in October 2019. I would like to note that the annual Fort Ross Dialogue on US-Russian Relations, which has been held for many years, is attended by representatives of municipal authorities as well. Also, a US-Russia Mayors' Summit was held two years ago. Inter-municipal ties are being developed with European partners, including between sister-cities. For example, relations are maintained between some 150 pairs of urban and municipal entities in Russia and Finland. Preparations are underway for a regular conference of Russian and Finnish sister-cities and municipalities, which is scheduled to take place in the Tver Region in June. Inter-municipal ties are growing stronger between Russia and Germany (I mentioned interregional ties before). A Twin-City Partnership Meeting between Russia and Germany was held in Dueren last year. Last year, Russia's Twin Cities International Association (TCIA) signed a memorandum on cooperation with the Association of Towns and Communities of Slovakia. The joint Russian-EU programmes of cross-border cooperation include multifaceted projects involving the municipal authorities of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The work of our representatives at the Council of Europe's Congress of Local and Regional Authorities offers opportunities for strengthening ties with foreign partners. Naturally, our attention is focused on the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Of course, we would like to see a more dynamic development of existing and the establishment of new ties between the municipalities of the Republic of Crimea and foreign partners. With this aim in view, we will continue to use the opportunities of the International Humanitarian Livadia Forum and the Yalta International Economic Forum. Overall, we believe that inter-municipal cooperation has good potential. I am referring, in particular, to the BRICS Friendship Cities and Local Governments Cooperation Forum and the initiative on establishing a non-governmental Secretariat of Sister-Cities and Municipalities of the Caspian Region. There are many topics we need to discuss. Let us hope that today we will be able to map out our future progress in this sphere. Of course, we also believe that we should review the legal framework of the international activities of Russian municipalities, including in the context of debates on the improvement of public authorities. I hope that ultimately we will enhance the standing of municipalities, including in international affairs. It is obvious that this objective cannot be achieved without resource, expert and administrative support. We will promote initiatives that provide for holding seminars and preparing recommended practices for local governments. We should probably use the ongoing discussions on improving the bodies of public authority to consider incorporating inter-municipal cooperation into a federal targeted programme so as to ensure sustainable financing for it. In general, I believe that a seamless coordination of the efforts of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Federal Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States, Compatriots Living Abroad, and International Cultural Cooperation (Rossotrudnichestvo), the Russian Justice Ministry and other federal bodies of executive authority, as well as the regional authorities and Russian NGOs is especially important at this stage.

However, it is not a completely regular gathering, as in a couple of weeks from now, on February 2, we will be marking 10 years since the signing of the Presidential directive On the Establishment of the Non-profit Partnership Russian International Affairs Council. I would like to use this occasion to congratulate all of you and us on this anniversary. The council has developed very interesting and sustainable traditions since then. The Foreign Ministry appreciates the comradely relations we maintain with RIAC, which has become a key think tank in the field of international affairs both in Russia and on the international arena. We set high store by RIAC's efforts to provide intellectual nourishment for Russian diplomacy, as well as give expert and analytical support to Russia's foreign policy. We especially need this now when the global situation is not just difficult, but also explosive and unpredictable too. President of Russia Vladimir Putin put forth the essence of the current stage in international affairs in his recent speeches, and it was also discussed at the events held at the Foreign Ministry. In a word, we are in the middle of a long era marked by an objective development of a new, fair and more democratic multipolar world order. This process is accompanied by heavy fighting between those who have ruled global affairs for centuries and the rising economic and political power centres. Humankind certainly stands to lose from some of our Western colleagues' insistence on the logic of not even yesterday but yesteryear, hoping to regain their global domination. Moreover, they have started acting more impulsively and aggressively. I would like to say a few words about the system of global strategic security, which is being destroyed. The Americans have destroyed two of the three fundamental documents - the ABM and the INF treaties. The New START Treaty, the last instrument of strategic stability, is hanging in the air. Russia's proposals for extending it were long ago sent in advance to our American partners and have been publicly reaffirmed, including by President Putin. We have not received any reply yet, but we do see movement in the opposite direction, towards building up tension in the sphere of strategic stability and nuclear arms. In addition, NATO has launched a very dangerous game of expanding its operations to two new media - outer space and cyberspace. We have said more than once that the justification offered for this policy is the \"rules-based order\", which aims to replace the system of international law that developed after WWII, with the United Nations Organisation at its centre. Unwillingness to create and respect new universal rules of the game, which would be codified in the system of international law, is only building mistrust. This leads to the appearance of new seats of instability and conflicts. The risk of any local confrontation growing into a global threat is increasing many times over. As you well know, Russia does not just play the role of a critic. We are advocating a constructive and universally acceptable international agenda based on the central coordinating role of the UN, as sealed in the UN Charter, as well as on the values set out in the UN Charter such as the sovereign equality of states, non-interference in others' internal affairs and a peaceful settlement of disputes. We remain open to the most serious dialogue on the fundamental principles of a stable world order. More than that, we have submitted proposals to this effect. As President Putin pointed out in his annual address to the Federal Assembly, the five nuclear countries who are the permanent members of the UN Security Council have a special role to play in this. We will continue working to raise the responsibility of these leading powers. Regrettably, our Western partners, while pursuing a policy of containing Russia, have deliberately suspended or curtailed many dialogue platforms and bilateral channels of communication between Russia and the European Union, including within the framework of the Russia-NATO Council. The role of \"second tracks\" and informal channels of communication, such as RIAC, as we see it, is increasing in these conditions. RIAC is an independent organisation, which allows it to make use of different views and opinions, including opposing ones. The statistics of RIAC's operation is self-explanatory. Mr Ivanov will talk in greater detail about this later. As far as I know, over the past year RIAC held more than 100 events attended by Russian and international experts, including large conferences on Russia's relations with China, the Middle East, the West, India and other leading countries and organisations. We greatly appreciate RIAC's analytical work. Last year it published a number of excellent papers, including forecasts, which do help us in preparing proposals for the leadership on new methods to further promote Russia's foreign policy. I would like to mention RIAC's traditionally substantial role when it comes to education.  RIAC and its partners organised two [summer] schools for young experts. Over 80 students from Russian and other universities, including American, British, Korean and other Asian universities, have had onsite training at RIAC. Other new forms that have gained in popularity include the RIAC Urban Breakfasts, a contest for young foreign-affairs journalists, plus webinars. RIAC's website is one of the most popular and respected sources of foreign policy information. I was delighted and pleasantly surprised to learn that the number of RIAC's contributors is approaching 1,000. This is a very large group of experts, which allows RIAC to present a broad range of expert views on foreign affairs. It is very good that there are many young experts among the council's contributors. Colleagues, This year we will celebrate two major events, the 75th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War and the 75th anniversary of the United Nations Organisation. You are aware, of course, about the information background accompanying the preparations for these events. I firmly believe that we must abide strictly by historical facts and archival material. Russia has demonstrated unprecedented openness when it comes to declassifying such material for the benefit of the general public. I believe that RIAC will give serious analytical and practical attention to these subjects this year, especially over the next few months, and that it will use its entire expert and analytical potential to prevent dialogue on these subjects from sliding into politics, leaving history to the historians and preventing any attempts to rewrite the history and outcome of WWII or to disparage the heroes of the Great Patriotic War and the liberators of Europe. On that note I would like to conclude my remarks and to wish every success to your highly commendable and close-knit staff.                  Advanced settings         Switcher      6 Photos close"},

It is always a pleasure for me to visit Uzbekistan, which is not simply an ally and strategic partner but a close friend of Russia too. Ties between our ministries are based not only on the political principles approved by our presidents, but also on personal sympathy and comradely relations. This is why we always deal with any problems on the basis of mutual respect and consideration for the other side's interests. I fully agree with what you have said about the current stage in Russia-Uzbekistan  relations. It can be described indeed as an unprecedented upswing in all spheres without exception, including the economy, humanitarian ties and defence industry cooperation. Nuclear engineering is the standard bearer of our interaction. We have special agreements the implementation of which our heads of state are monitoring. When it comes to education, there are quite a few branches of Russian universities here, which once again confirms the closeness of our peoples and interests. We are preparing for the upcoming state visit by President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Russia. Before it, the Intergovernmental Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation will convene to discuss the draft documents that are scheduled to be signed at the top level. We have a number of proposals regarding the best way to prepare this important event in our bilateral relations. Of course, our meeting today offers an opportunity to exchange views on international matters, including Central Asia, Afghanistan, the Middle East and North Africa, as well as our interaction at international organisations, primarily the UN. I also hope that we will be able to have a constructive discussion of our plans regarding cooperation within the CIS. We would like Uzbekistan to strengthen its ties with the EAEU and the CSTO.

The first time you visited us in this capacity was on January 21, 2019, almost exactly a year ago. Over the period that you have headed your office, I believe we (I mean the international community interested in the Syrian settlement) have been able to achieve some very positive shifts. The situation on the ground is definitely improving. The territory controlled by terrorists continues to shrink. The Syrian government has regained control of a large part of the border with Iraq and Turkey. Efforts are being made to suppress the remnants of terrorist groups both in the Idlib zone and in northeastern Syria. The second major sphere of our   work is the humanitarian part of the settlement process. Here, the continuing terrorist threat I have already mentioned has a direct negative effect. Terrorists are hindering the delivery of humanitarian relief, misappropriating the goods successfully delivered to the relevant regions of Syria. This is something that requires special attention and consideration, including in Geneva, where the humanitarian task force is based. It is essential in the context of restoring the Syrian statehood and creating conditions for the return of refugees to territories controlled by the legitimate government that the international community enables the largest aid delivery possible, especially with the coordinating role of the UN. However, we can see the obvious bias of some of the Western donors, double standards on their part, as the key Western capitals do not want to send aid to territories controlled by the government, but focus on areas controlled by the opposition, including by radical opposition groups. The second task force in Geneva, the humanitarian affairs group, definitely needs to focus more closely on this situation. The third track, which will probably require the greatest attention during our talks today, is the political process, and the work of the Constitutional Committee. We value your personal and your team's approach to creating the conditions for the negotiators to develop a culture of dialogue and trust in each other. This is a very important, integral component of success. Just like you, we are not overdramatising the fact that there are no extraordinary achievements in just a couple of months after the Constitutional Committee was established. This had not been planned. This is an absolutely natural situation. We will do our best to facilitate your efforts to create the necessary conditions for progress at the next session of the Small Body, which will meet when you consider it possible to schedule it. So, we indeed have something to talk about. Welcome.                  Advanced settings         Switcher      6 Photos close"},
{"Title": "Acting Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's remarks and answers to media questions at a news conference on Russia's diplomatic performance in 2019  Moscow, January 17, 2020", "articleID": "4001740", "article_URL": "https://www.mid.ru/en/press_service/minister_speeches/-/asset_publisher/7OvQR5KJWVmR/content/id/4001740", "ArticleText": "Toggle navigation      / / Asset Publisher 17 January 2020 69-17-01-2020 Colleagues, Our views on current international issues have been presented by President of Russia Vladimir Putin in great detail and more than once, including at the annual news conference in December last year and the other day in the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly. I would like to point out in my opening remarks that the world is still running a high fever, as we can clearly see. The main destabilising factor is the aggressive policy of several Western countries, primarily our American colleagues, aimed at destroying the international legal framework of security and replacing international law with their own invention, a \"rules-based world order.\" Examples include Washington's destruction of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty), unwillingness to discuss the extension of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), deliberate fanning of tensions in the Persian Gulf, attempts to revise the generally recognised basis for a Middle East settlement, NATO's increased military activity near the Russian border and attempts to take over the multilateral mechanisms for controlling WMD. The lack of trust in global politics and the economy is being aggravated by methods of unfair competition, such as unilateral sanctions, protectionism and trade wars. The latest example of this was the US attempts to hinder the implementation of the Nord Stream 2 project contrary to the opinion of the leading EU countries. Washington is blatantly abusing the privileges it has as the host country of the UN Headquarters. Acting at its own discretion in violation of international law, Washington has denied the representatives of \"undesirable\" countries the opportunity to attend events held at the UN platform. This could be yet another manifestation of the \"rules-based order.\" Russian diplomacy is pursuing an independent multivector policy set out by the President of Russia and has been working to reduce international tensions and to strengthen the democratic principles of international communication based on law. We are doing our best to maintain all aspects of global and regional security. Our top priorities include the fight against international terrorism, in particular in Syria, as well as efforts to promote a political process here and to settle the current humanitarian problems of Syrians. Our achievements last year include the launch of the intra-Syrian Constitutional Committee through the concerted efforts of the guarantor countries of the Astana format. Syria's post-conflict rehabilitation and its reintegration into the Arab family are gaining priority now. We will do our best to promote this. We also contributed to efforts to overcome other conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, including in Libya and Yemen. The situation in the region could be greatly improved through the implementation of Russia's Collective Security Concept for the Persian Gulf Region. We presented a revised concept last summer at a seminar attended by experts and researchers from the regional countries.  Russia traditionally prioritises expanded collaboration with its partners in the Eurasian space, primarily within the framework of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, the Union State, the CIS and the Eurasian Economic Union. I would like to single out our achievements in promoting Eurasian integration, including the EAEU's expanded foreign ties. As you know, free trade agreements were signed with Vietnam in 2016 and with Singapore and Serbia in 2019. Agreements on trade and economic cooperation between the Eurasian Economic Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as an interim agreement with Iran, entered into force last year. Active talks continue with Israel and Egypt. It has been decided to launch a negotiating process with India. All these actions are in line with Russian President Vladimir Putin's initiative to establish a Greater Eurasian Partnership that would be open to all the countries of our common continent, Eurasia. Russian-Chinese relations of a comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation continued to expand. In June 2019, President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Russia, with the sides announcing that bilateral relations had entered a new era. Moscow-Beijing foreign policy coordination exerted an important stabilising influence on the global situation. Special and privileged strategic partnership with India, diverse ties with ASEAN countries, as well as other Asian and Latin American states, continued to become stronger. Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the African continent received a substantial impetus. As you know, the first Russia-Africa summit in history took place in October 2019, and its results elevate Russian-African dialogue to an entirely new level. We managed to make headway in resolving the domestic Ukrainian crisis. A Normandy format summit took place after a three-year interval after the new Kiev leaders managed to start fulfilling the decisions of the two earlier Normandy Four summits. We hope that the December 2019 decisions in Paris will make it possible to move ahead in implementing the Minsk Package of Measures. But, of course, these decisions should not remain on paper, like during the Poroshenko regime. This year, there are plans to continue maintaining global security and strategic stability, including efforts to prevent an arms race in outer space and the unacceptability of weaponising cyberspace. We will completely activate the potential of the UN, the G20, the CIS, and the Eurasian Economic Union, as well as the possibilities opened up by Russia's presidency of BRICS and the SCO. We will focus on our work with the four other permanent UN Security Council members, including on such key aspects as the preservation and consolidation of the UN's central coordinating role in global affairs and the inviolability of the principles governing international affairs as set forth in the UN Charter. An overwhelming majority of states supports us in these efforts. In conclusion, I would, of course, like to note that two major anniversaries occur this year: the 75  anniversary of the Victory in World War II and the Great Patriotic War, as well as the 75  anniversary of establishing the UN. We will continue to do everything possible to combat the falsification of history, to preserve the good reputation of victorious soldiers and to prevent a revision of the internationally recognised results of the defeat of Nazism. Many responsible countries of the world have joined us in defending the historical memory. I would also like to note the contribution of our compatriots living abroad to this work. We are looking forward to seeing our foreign partners at the May 9 celebrations in Moscow. Thank you, I am ready to answer your questions. We know that Russia and China plan to jointly celebrate the 75  anniversary of Victory in WWII in 2020. Our countries have done a great deal to help build the post-war world order. What role are they playing now in the maintenance of global stability? How would you describe Russian-Chinese cooperation in this sphere? I have already spoken about our strategic relations with China. We hold similar views on all the key international issues. Our views and approaches have been incorporated in a number of joint documents signed by President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of China Xi Jinping, including the Joint Statement on Developing Comprehensive Partnership and Strategic Interaction Entering a New Era signed in June 2019 during the Chinese leader's visit to Russia, which has advanced our strategic relations to a higher level. We are closely coordinating our moves at the UN. We try to support one another and to uphold the principles of the UN Charter that serve as the basis of the global organisation. We support one another at the UN Security Council when considering issues that imply the need to uphold these principles in each particular crisis situation, as we did during the recent discussion on the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria. We coordinate the way we vote and invariably support justice, trying to prevent the adoption of decisions which our Western colleagues often try to impose on us so as to further their unilateral agenda disregarding the need for reaching consensus. I mentioned the decision on extending the cross-border assistance mechanism, which was ultimately adopted taking into consideration the position of Russia and China. Our Western partners used every trick in the book to keep open one crossing point for humanitarian deliveries, called Al Yarubiyah, on the Iraqi-Syrian border. They claimed that the closure of that crossing would amount to a humanitarian disaster for the Syrians living in the north-eastern regions. We knew that this was not so. Our Western colleagues only wanted to preserve the Al Yarubiyah crossing so as to legitimise the illegal presence of the US-led coalition forces east of the Euphrates. An objective look at the humanitarian deliveries east of the Euphrates shows that over two months last year, in October and November, UN forces supported by the Syrian Government delivered more than 420 truckloads of aid, including 162 tonnes of medical goods, equipment and medicines, from Damascus and Qamishli to the north-eastern regions, whereas only slightly more than 100 trucks used the Al Yarubiyah crossing in the past 20 months. Deliveries made via that crossing were many times smaller than the aid delivered with the assistance of the Syrian Government and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent. This is one example of how we use facts to protect the truth together with our Chinese partners and to prevent the use of the UN Security Council and its decisions as instruments of unilateral pressure on dissenting regimes.  At what stage is the Syrian crisis now? What is preventing its resolution? Can we expect to see relations restored between Syria and Turkey, the European Union and the Arab world this year?  I would say the Syrian crisis is now in an advanced stage of settlement. There has been progress on almost all tracks - in the military, political, diplomatic, and humanitarian areas. Economic recovery is lagging slightly behind, because our Western partners and several countries in the region have put forward their preconditions. What's more, those preconditions change depending on what happens in real life. First they said they would remove the restrictions on providing assistance to Syria for the return of refugees and economic recovery as soon as the political process begins. The political process has been launched; now they are saying they need to wait until it yields results. It looks like they will keep lifting the bar, changing their demands during the game. This is definitely not helping to get results. What is important is a decisive victory in the fight against terrorism. The remaining islands of resistance from ISIS and al-Nusra are mainly in the Idlib de-escalation zone and on the eastern bank, where there are about 10,000 ISIS members in my estimate. They are mostly in camps controlled by the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), mainly Kurdish units. There have been alarming reports we are verifying now that that the SDF release terrorist fighters to go and freely settle in other parts of Syria for a bribe. This information raises concerns. We have long warned our American partners, who have influence on the SDF, that they should prevent the escape of militants from camps where they are held in custody. Unfortunately, there is a risk that this can happen. I have already mentioned the Syrian Government's cooperation with the UN, citing an example that underscores that there are no longer any reasons for maintaining UN operations to deliver humanitarian aid across the Syrian border without consulting the Syrian Government. Humanitarian assistance really helps to create conditions for the return of refugees. Russia is also doing a lot bilaterally - in addition to contributing to the relevant UN funds that provide assistance to Syrians and other peoples in the region - including through our military deployed on the ground, the military police and other units. We are assisting in efforts to restore vital systems such as water and electricity supply, and the most basic educational and healthcare services. We urge all countries to follow suit, without trying to politicise humanitarian assistance or making any geopolitical demands for it. On the political track, as I said, we have seen a result in the form of the Constitutional Committee, which has set up a small body responsible for preparing and drafting the constitutional proposals and adopted the core rules of the procedure. Two meetings have been held, and a third one is being organised. Next week, we are expecting a visit by Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Syria Geir Pedersen, who also plans to visit Damascus. I hope that these negotiations and his contacts with the Syrian leaders will result in drafting a schedule for the Constitutional Committee's further work. We are certainly confident in the need to correct the mistake made when Syria was expelled from the Arab League in 2011. That country needs to return to the \"Arab family,\" as the President of Russia has repeatedly said.  Russia and Italy have long discussed the Libya crisis. What mistakes do you think the current and past Italian cabinets have made in recent years regarding Libya? What can the Italians do now compared to the past? What do you expect from the conference on Libya in Berlin?  The main mistake was not made by Italy, but by our NATO colleagues. As far as I know, in 2011, Italy did not play the critical role in taking the decision to bomb Libya and to overthrow the regime in violation of the UN Security Council resolution. I will not list the names of the leaders of that epic adventure as I think everyone knows them. Then, Libyan statehood was destroyed and has not been restored so far. There have been many attempts to assist the Libyan parties in reaching at least some kind of agreement and returning their country to normal life. There was the Libyan Political Agreement signed in Skhirat, which is still regarded by most external parties as containing the basic principles for a Libya settlement. Of course, life goes on, and other things can be added, all the more so as agreements were signed in Abu Dhabi earlier last year, which also concerned state power in Libya but which, unfortunately, were not implemented. A conference was held in Paris where a specific date for elections in Libya was set. But, as you know, we should never get ahead of ourselves and set overly concrete goals. Diplomacy is an unhurried process. There was a conference in Palermo, where useful work was done as well. In response to our Turkish colleagues' proposals, we volunteered to try to contribute to these efforts. We invited the leaders of eastern and western Libya to meet, and they accepted our invitation. We had talks with the delegations led by Commander of the Libyan National Army Marshal Khalifa Haftar and Chairman of the Tobruk-based House of Representatives of Libya Aguila Saleh, representing one side, and Prime Minister of the Government of the National Accord of Libya (PNS) Fayez al-Sarraj and Chairman of the High Council of State Khalid al-Mishri, representing the other side, which lasted over seven hours. There is a text that we believe is quite balanced. It calls for a ceasefire and the beginning of a political process. It was signed by Fayez al-Sarraj and Khalid al-Mishri. Marshal Khalifa Haftar and Aguila Saleh asked for extra time. Most importantly, the truce, which was announced before their arrival in Moscow, is being respected. This is a definite step forward. Let's hope that the truce remains in place, preferably indefinitely. At least German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas recently met with Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi and stated that the marshal had confirmed his commitment to a ceasefire. This is already a useful development. We supported the initiative to hold the Berlin Conference from day one, because the more countries are willing to help the Libyans create proper conditions for a settlement, the better. Persuading these people to do anything is not easy, so we must work together. We will participate in the conference in Berlin on Sunday for these reasons. We participated in all five preparatory meetings. I believe that the final documents have been agreed upon almost in full. They are fully consistent with the decisions adopted by the UN Security Council on a Libya settlement and do not contain any provisions that are at odds with its decisions. We tried to bring them to a proper condition during the talks. What matters now is that after the Berlin Conference - if everything goes as planned and the UN Security Council supports its results - the Libyan parties do not repeat their past mistakes and do not put forward additional conditions or blame each other. So far, relations between them have been very tense. They don't even want to be in the same room, not to mention talk or meet with each other. We will participate in this conference alongside our Italian colleagues. I have a morning meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio in Berlin before the conference.  Will Russia have a new foreign policy doctrine, in you view, given the latest constitutional amendments proposed by President of Russia Vladimir Putin and new appointments? We know that the foreign policy course is determined by the President. We are accustomed to you always referring to the \"supremacy of international law.\" We understand that these amendments are to enhance Russia's sovereignty and that this is a necessary step to protect our common national interests. What changes may follow in practice?  President of Russia Vladimir Putin has already commented on our attitude to international law and the way it corresponds to our laws and the Russian Constitution. According to the Constitutional Court's explanations given some time ago in response to a relevant inquiry, the Constitution contains basic, fundamental rules determining all our actions. No international agreements should contradict our Constitution. I want to draw your attention to the following. Any international agreement adopted by the Russian Federation, to which it accedes, is signed and submitted to the Russian parliament - the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation - for ratification. Ratification takes the form of a federal law. Thus, our international commitments, first, become part of our legal system, since they become a federal law, and, second, a federal law cannot be adopted if it runs counter to the Constitution. I do not see here any pretext or reason for speculating or searching for any hidden meaning. Protesters in Lebanon approached the perimeter of the Russian diplomatic mission in Beirut yesterday. Could it be a message to Russia in connection with its policy in that region from outside parties that support and drive the revolutionary process in Lebanon? We appreciate the way the Lebanese leadership and the relevant services responded to that incident. I don't see any reason to invent a conspiracy theory or a plot. As far as I understand, the Embassy is near a centre holding those arrested for participating in the riot, whom the protesters are trying to free. Two tear gas grenades fell on the Embassy grounds. They caused no harm to people or property. As I have said, Lebanese services assured us that they would pay greater attention to the security of our diplomatic mission.  You began your remarks by saying the world is \"running a high fever.\" Indeed, over the past year, we have seen rallies around the world. Protests have flared up in various parts of the world, from Latin America to Hong Kong. However, the key question is - what is causing this infection, and how? In most cases, we have seen support for these movements from Washington, that is, we saw that these sentiments were being fueled artificially. In the first week of 2020, pressure from the United States began gaining new momentum, with the US-Iranian crisis. How much should we fear the continuation of this trend in 2020? Are we in for more \"Venezuelas\" - states with dual governments? What do you think awaits Iran in 2020?  It is difficult to make any forecasts. According to one of Viktor Chernomyrdin's great aphorisms, \"Forecasting is a thankless job, especially when it comes to predicting the future.\" It is truly difficult to \"predict the future,\" primarily in relation to how our American colleagues will behave. You have listed some examples of their actions. It is difficult to predict what they will invent this year, but nothing can be ruled out. I have mentioned many times that they are trying to replace international law with some rules-based order, something the West primarily needs. This is an attempt to delay the forming of a democratic and polycentric world order, which is an objectively unfolding process. The West is trying to deter the development of major powers. We can see how much effort the trade dialogue between China and the United States is taking. Just in case, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has a dispute resolution body. But that body has been impotent for more than a year because the United States is blocking the appointment of participants in its mechanism, and it does not have a quorum. Instead of resolving the emerging problems in world trade through a universally agreed upon international legal mechanism in the WTO dispute settlement body, the United States prefers to deal with its competitors one on one. Just this morning I read that the European Commission has expressed concern that the recently reached US-Chinese agreement might be violating the principles of free trade and WTO rules. The European Commission has reserved the right to return to this issue later. But as regards questions that directly relate to international security and weapons of mass destruction proliferation problems, here too, they are making attempts to take these processes into their own hands and preclude a transparent, universal dialogue with the aim to reach consensus-based decisions that will be approved by all. You can see what is being done at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). I have talked about this more than once. The Technical Secretariat has been, completely illegally, given the function of determining guilty parties, in flagrant violation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction (CWC). They are trying to apply just about the same approach to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction (BTWC), where Russia, and most other countries, helped create a verification mechanism. The Americans are actually single-handedly blocking this decision and are trying to advance their own interests, including in post-Soviet countries, through the secretariats of international organisations, including through the UN Secretariat, as well as through their closed-door, non-transparent, secretive bilateral contacts. Biolaboratories are being set up with the Pentagon. These are all very serious things. Again, these things cause everyone's concern. But the Americans do not want to consider them honestly, with the participation of all parties, signatories to the BTWC. You mentioned Iran. There is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for the Iranian nuclear programme (JCPOA), which is an integral part of international law, approved by the UN Security Council in a binding resolution. This is an international law. The Americans decided to apply their own rules - and abandoned this comprehensive plan. Not only did they stop fulfilling their obligations, but they also forbid everyone else to trade with Iran. At the same time, Iran is required to abide by the document that President Donald Trump dubbed \"the worst deal ever negotiated,\" adding that a new one needs to be adopted. But Iran still must comply with it. Everyone should obey the United States and refrain from trading with Iran, but Iran must still fulfill its obligations. This is an alarming situation. And it is taking an even more dangerous turn now: three European countries parties to the JCPOA - UK, France and Germany - have sent a letter to EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, in which they said they wanted to launch the dispute resolution process provided for in the JCPOA proper. This letter was closed, but it is known to have been received. So what is happening is close to what President of Russia Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned about. He said that at some point the Europeans would take advantage of the situation in Iran, some of Iran's future actions, to be able to shift the blame onto Iran for everything that happened. Iran - we have also mentioned this before - has, in fact, suspended only the commitments it voluntarily assumed, in addition to its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the nuclear safeguards agreement with the IAEA, and the obligations under the Additional Protocol to it. Everything Iran is doing in the nuclear field is open and accessible to IAEA inspectors. Iran is now the most verified country of all the NPT member countries. When European countries said Iran is now obligated to take certain measures, they regretted that the United States withdrew from the JCPOA, but addressed their demands to Iran, harshly and with an accusatory tinge. Just yesterday, I read the news that German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer confirmed the rumors that before the foreign ministers of Germany, Britain and France wrote that letter, the Americans advanced an ultimatum to those three countries, threatening to levy 25 percent duties on automotive and other products if they do not abandon the JCPOA and begin to advocate the development of a new treaty that would satisfy the United States. That was directly stated by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who called for tossing out the old deal and signing a new one, which would not be Barack Obama's deal, but Donald Trump's. The methods used by our American partners are quite diverse. I simply cannot predict what might happen in the future, although we continue the dialogue with the Americans on all problems, as well as with the Europeans. A few days ago, the deputy heads of the foreign affairs agencies of Russia and the United States had a regular meeting on strategic stability. They discussed the entire range of issues on the agenda, including the topic of predictability. I cannot say that any impressive result has been achieved, but the dialogue continues. We are determined to continue working to ensure that our world still has at least some agreements that will hold back and control weapons, especially nuclear weapons, and require the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It was for a reason that Russian President Vladimir Putin in his Address to the Federal Assembly highlighted the role of the five nuclear powers that are permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is not a privilege but a huge responsibility to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council and to have the right of veto. This is actually a responsibility that cannot be easily discounted; our President's call to the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to recognise and demonstrate their responsibility, in accordance with the UN Charter, for everything that happens in the field of military-political security in the world, must be heard.  I would like to ask about the three Russian journalists killed in the Central African Republic. It was reported recently that local law enforcement agencies incinerated the journalists' clothes, which were material evidence in the case. Has the Russian Foreign Ministry contacted its CAR colleagues? How could this happen to material evidence if the investigation into the journalists' murder is not over in Russia yet? Of course, we contacted them. Frankly, I have not heard about the incineration of the clothes. But our Investigative Committee has indeed opened criminal proceedings. We have commented on this more than once; in particular, our official spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, has done so. We noted that the investigation must be conducted by the concerned authorities, in this case, Russia's Investigative Committee. We also expressed the opinion of the Foreign Ministry, which is responsible for creating conditions for the foreign travel of our citizens. We notified everyone, especially journalists, but also other professionals, that the objectives indicated in their visa applications correspond to the real goals they are pursuing upon crossing the border. This is a huge tragedy. We will insist that the investigation be completed. I know that journalism is a dangerous profession and that, regrettably, your colleagues die every year. It is best to notify the Russian authorities when you plan to work in hot spots, so we know at the least where our citizens might go. I understand that you have a right not to inform us about your plans. But I would like you and your colleagues to consider this request for reasons of your own safety if you plan to travel to dangerous regions. You said in Nagoya last year that Russia had forwarded a list of Russia's specific [security] concerns [to its Japanese colleagues]. I believe that you are concerned about the deployment of US missile defence systems in Japan. What [security] guarantees should Japan give to Russia to make progress at the talks possible? Your concerns cannot be eliminated completely as long as Japan and the United States remain allies.  You have said it all. It is a very serious matter indeed and a vital part of our dialogue with Japan, and not only when it comes to the peace treaty. As a matter of fact, we do not want any threat to Russia to come from the territory of a good neighbour, as we see Japan. It is true that we have certain concerns. They have been formulated and are being discussed within the framework of a dialogue being held by our deputy foreign ministers as well as by the secretaries of our national security councils. The Secretary General of Japan's National Security Council, Shigeru Kitamura, visited Russia yesterday. He met with the Secretary of Russia's Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev and President Vladimir Putin. These issues were on the agenda. You mentioned that Japan is deploying land-based missile defence systems on its territory. Our Japanese colleagues told us long ago that they were doing this to protect the country from the threat coming from the Korean Peninsula and that these systems would be operated exclusively by Japanese crews. They said that these systems would be subordinate to Japan's Self-Defence Forces. We are trying to specify the details pertaining to these matters, though this is not the main point. Japan is deploying anti-missile launchers it buys in the United States, launchers that the Americans have used to launch not only anti-missiles but also attack, including cruise, missiles. This class of weapons was prohibited under the INF Treaty until the Americans discarded it. This means that attack missiles can be deployed near our border. We need to take this into account, of course. We do not suspect the Japanese authorities or political elite of evil plans against Russia, not at all. But they do have a military alliance with the United States, as you said. If you read the documents, statements and decisions made within the framework of this alliance, you will see that the United States is using it in the interests of its containment policy towards Russia. To them, Russia is an opponent, and Japan is part of this military strategy of its close ally, the United States. Of course, we want clarity regarding this matter. We want to understand how our cooperation will develop if the Americans are trying to involve Japan in their policy, which has been legally declared to be spearheaded against Russia. A dialogue is very important. But we want absolute clarity. The impeachment procedure will likely begin in the US Senate on Tuesday. Many people in the West say this will weaken US support for Ukraine and strengthen Russia's position. What is your opinion? This is your impeachment. You are an American and should know better. You said in October 2019 that BRICS was the embodiment of multipolar diplomacy. What key goals were attained last year? And, can you say a few words about the 2020 goals?  I will not waste time on this now. This is about facts. Our programme has been posted on Russia's BRICS presidency website. We can send out more copies, if needed. We have prepared answers to frequently asked questions about the organisation. We will post them on the website, and you will be able to go there. The plans for our presidency include over 100 events. Many of them will be held not only in Moscow and St Petersburg, but in other cities as well. For example, ministerial meetings are to be held in the Urals. I believe this is a good idea. The crown event of Russia's presidency, the BRICS summit, will be held in St Petersburg in the latter half of July. We are preparing for it now.  The Latvian parliament yesterday accused Russia of falsifying WWII history. It is a fact, however, that history is most often falsified in the Baltic countries. The worst part is that international organisations believe them. As a result, we have scandalous documents like last year's resolution by the European Parliament that casts equal blame for the war on the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. How could we allow this to happen? What can Russia do to protect its interests and historical truth? What steps should it take?  How did we allow neo-Nazism to flourish in the EU? Because we cannot use force to influence the situation. But we can and have been criticising the EU for this. Unfortunately, they look away and avoid discussing the matter. At best, they talk about the importance of respecting freedom of opinion and expression. This is why they abstain every year during the UN General Assembly vote when we submit a resolution on combating the glorification of Nazism and preventing the revival of any form of xenophobia. By the way, the US and the Ukrainians both vote against this, which is not surprising either. Americans do not want to see any restrictions on their actions, and Ukrainians, if they support our resolution, will be unable to stand up against the neo-Nazi radicals who are strengthening their influence in Ukraine. But I cannot agree that international organisations are supporting them, as you say. The international organisation I have mentioned - the UN General Assembly - adopts a resolution renouncing neo-Nazism and the glorification of Nazi criminals by an overwhelming majority of 130-140 votes every year. The European Parliament is an international but not a global organisation. Many events are taking place at the European Parliament, as well as at the EU, at the initiative of a minority and they are explained by the rules of consensus and the need to respect the opinions of others. However, this is an aggressive minority. You were correct that the Baltic and several other countries are playing first fiddle in this. As for the facts provided by President Putin in his speech at the informal CIS summit held in St Petersburg in December 2019, the reaction to them showed that the cap fits. You may remember that President Putin said he was writing an article based entirely on facts and new data from the Russian archives. By the way, yesterday the Defence Ministry published declassified archive documents about who liberated Warsaw and how it was done. The Polish diplomats said they would like to make use of President Putin's idea and browse the archives. Timing is everything, as they say. The archive materials are available, and it would be very interesting to hear what the Polish side says after studying them. There will be more attempts to slander Russia by falsifying the results and causes of WWII and to use these lies to weaken Russia's position on the international stage. An international event will be held in Jerusalem for International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which President Putin will attend. We know for a fact that our Polish colleagues - President Andrzej Duda said he would not attend the event, possibly because President Putin would - have been trying to convince their Western colleagues (the event will be attended by US officials and some European leaders) to put forth the Polish view on Russia's attitude to WWII. This is going outside the bounds of acceptable behaviour, considering the event they want this to take place at.  Kazakhstan conducted several special operations to return some 600 citizens from Syria, including 400 children. More recently another operation resulted in bringing about 14 children from Iraq after their relations with relatives from Kazakhstan were established through DNA tests. How do you assess Kazakhstan's efforts to bring its citizens home from that region?  I believe these are actions that any sovereign state has the right to take in order to fulfil its obligations to its citizens. We are dealing with the same issues. Our military, special services, the Commissioner for Children's Rights are working to return our children from Iraq and Syria. We have exchanged experience with our colleagues in Kazakhstan. I was in Uzbekistan yesterday. Our Uzbek friends are also rescuing their citizens, at least the wives and children. The fighters are a separate issue. I have already touched on the problem now emerging in eastern Syria, where militants are escaping from detention camps. In most cases, those women had been drugged, meaning they had not travelled to those places of their own free will. The children are definitely innocent. I certainly want them to return to their normal environment and grow up to be normal people, not under the influence of radical terrorist ideas. Do you think the Polish authorities' actions in cemeteries are appropriate? Specifically, I mean the demolition of monuments by bulldozers? Ex-President of Poland Lech Walesa said in an interview with Channel One he would visit Russia. What do you think about the possibility of Nobel Prize winner Lech Walesa replacing the current President of Poland Andrzej Duda?  Concerning their treatment of the monuments, I have already briefly discussed the topic of the outcome of World War II. I am confident that we need to rely on, and stick to, historical facts. We are always open to dialogue based on archival documents. For a long time, Poland and Russia had a system of bilateral mechanisms and communication channels, including the Strategic Committee led by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, with the participation of many other government departments. That system involved a group of historians who studied difficult issues from the past, but always built their positions on proven facts. Some time ago, this group prepared a book on a certain stage in our relations, on our shared history with Poland. Cooperative articles were written on a number of episodes from that period; on those where historians' opinions differed, Polish and Russian views were laid out separately. I believe this should resume, and should not be linked to any attempt to turn history into propaganda. As our Polish colleagues demolish monuments, they also state their position arguing that Poland never agreed to maintain the monuments that are not in cemeteries. They are ready to protect only memorials at gravesites. This is a small-minded approach. If we use it, we will lose our sense of decency. We are talking about people who died, who gave their lives, the most precious thing they had, for the liberation of Europe. So I fully share the position of those (including President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman) who condemn the destruction of the monuments from that war. As for Lech Walesa, he is a respected person and known as a completely independent politician. He has his own opinion, which he does not hesitate to express and defend. If he is interested in coming to Russia, that's up to him. We will be happy to help make his stay here as comfortable as we can. As for meetings at the political level, this question is not for me.  What do you think about Russian-German relations after Chancellor Merkel's recent visit? Was there a breakthrough? This was her first visit to Moscow in five years.  I don't think contact between President Putin and Chancellor Merkel need to be aimed at some kind of a breakthrough at this point. They regularly meet on the sidelines of various events (there was a meeting in Paris recently before the Chancellor arrived in Moscow) and talks over the phone. These are working, substantive and pragmatic relations. No one is trying to convince the other party that someone is wrong and that ideological differences must be resolved before anything else can be done. We understand there are sanctions. Unfortunately, Germany adopted this policy following the coup in Ukraine, which took place in a situation where Berlin's position was ignored and the putschists regarded it as a nonentity. After all, Germany guaranteed the agreement that the putschists trampled on. I have already mentioned this. Unfortunately, along with some other European countries, Germany then simply shrugged and spread its hands in a helpless gesture and put up with the illegal acts committed against its will and the provisions of the document that it signed. It began to look into the Ukraine crisis from the point in time where Russia responded to the will of the residents of Crimea, and Crimea rejoined Russia following the referendum. Our Western colleagues count from here. The way this coup occurred and the way its leaders immediately passed a law repealing the rights of the Russian-speaking people and the putschists from national-radical organisations demanded that the Russians \"get out\" of Crimea - none of that \"counts,\" but was \"before.\" The West only got upset when the Crimeans did what they dreamed of during the decades following the collapse of the Soviet Union. That's the problem. Merkel's visit was not anything extraordinary. Our German colleagues were especially interested in the success of the Berlin Conference on Libya, and focused a lot on this. Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel spent about an hour talking face to face. Meanwhile, we spoke with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and his staff. Of course, they talked about the economy and energy, including Nord Stream. All of that was mentioned in the opening remarks, during the news conference and in the answers to questions. I believe this was a normal, solid working visit. This is what the pragmatism of our relations with Germany is all about.  Regarding Iran, you criticised the United States and three European countries a lot, but didn't mention what Russia can do now to prevent the further escalation of the conflict with Iran?  I hope you are following our remarks and initiatives. We believe what is happening to the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) is untenable. The plan was for Iran to limit its nuclear programme to certain variables with regard to enrichment, the amount of heavy water available at each particular moment and enriched uranium reserves (about 4 percent). Iran assumed commitments that call for more than universal non-proliferation agreements, requirements and IAEA documents. In response to what it will accomplish beyond its usual international commitments, it promised to see restrictions on trade with Iran removed (the West did not agree to provide real favourable terms and conditions). This wasn't delivered, either. The United States made it illegal for everyone to trade with Iran, and is threatening with sanctions. The Europeans did some tough talking and even said they would create a mechanism for trading with Iran bypassing the dollar and the United States. This was created more than a year ago and is called INSTEX and is used exclusively for servicing transactions involving solely humanitarian goods that are not subject to US sanctions. They said that subsequently, when the mechanism becomes operational, it would apply to servicing trade in other goods, including oil, as well, which is of paramount importance for Iran. For over a year, this mechanism has not been used for a single transaction. One was started, but never finished. It involves medicines worth $10 million. You be the judge of what kind of a drop it is in the ocean. When Iran says it will \"suspend\" the implementation of its voluntary commitments, we, of course, believe that this does not help the cause, but gives the Americans a reason to further aggravate the situation. But we see the reason Iran is forced to act this way. It is not saying no to everything else that is mandatory for all states parties to the INF Treaty. We believe that the Europeans should and can do much more. There is a problem stemming from private business solutions. You cannot force a private company to trade at a loss. If a company has interests and investments directly related to the use of the dollar in the United States or elsewhere, the company itself must decide on where it is going to operate. We understand what kind of a solution that may be. But there are companies that do not have any commitments or interests in a territory that US lawmakers can somehow limit or squeeze. The question of what we should do next is being discussed literally now. Our deputy foreign ministers are in constant contact with the European Foreign Service that coordinates the JCPOA. I think we will need to hold a meeting soon to figure out what's going on and who thinks what. Our partners, the so-called Western Troika (Great Britain, France and Germany), assure us that their actions, criticism and demands on Iran are designed solely to save the JCPOA, nothing else. At about the same time that we saw these assurances coming from the three capitals, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson proposed repealing the deal concluded by former President Obama and concluding another one that suits the current President, Donald Trump. Then they tried to disavow everything, but as you know the spoken word takes flight. Regarding what we will do next, I think we need to hold a meeting of political directors of the remaining JCPOA members, including the European troika, and Russia, China and of course Iran, sit down and have a candid conversation. A new Government is being formed in Russia. Will you keep the post of foreign minister? Do you want to? You have probably been working as a journalist for a long time, and understand everything. See, everyone is laughing. Three days ago I was asked to become acting foreign minister, and I am doing this. What is your impression of your meeting with Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi? Have you come to an agreement on trading in national currencies? We did not discuss this during my meeting with Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. We have mechanisms for servicing our foreign trade and economic ties, which are the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Commission. It meets quite often; the next meeting will take place this year. We mostly discussed political issues on our agenda, such as our cooperation within the SCO and BRICS, especially in light of Russia's presidency of these two groups this year. We also talked about developments in the Asian-Pacific Region, including the introduction of a new term, the Indo-Pacific. We used to have the Asian-Pacific Region, but our American colleagues are promoting the Indo-Pacific. They are promoting the Indo-Pacific Strategy now just as they introduced the term \"rules-based order\" in the past. We did not discuss our attitude to the term, name or concept, but the attitude of Russia and India to the development of relations on a multilateral basis in our common region. We have almost identical approaches to this. Neither India, nor Russia supports the attempts to use the concept of the Indo-Pacific Strategy to create confrontational configurations in this region. We believe that we must continue to cooperate based on the multilateral organisations that have been created on the initiative of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). They include the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the meeting of ASEAN defence ministers and dialogue partners (ADMM-Plus). Another important mechanism is the East Asia Summit (EAS), where we can discuss absolutely any issue without exception. In this context, it was very useful for us to see that the positions of Russia and India are nearly identical. The problem of terms is another matter. I have raised this question with our American and Japanese colleagues, and we can also ask the Australians (the concept is mostly promoted by the United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea) whether the replacement of the term \"Asian-Pacific\" with \"Indo-Pacific\" means that East Africa will be involved in this new cooperation process. The answer is \"No.\" Or does this mean that the Persian Gulf will become party to these discussions because it is an extension of the Indian Ocean? No again. It turns out that the participants are the same as in the Asian-Pacific region but some of them would like to draw dividing lines. This is what it is all about. Those who are advocating this concept make no secret of this. It was very important for me to establish that our Indian friends are fully aware of this. What is Russia's opinion on the numerous attempts to discuss Kashmir at the UN Security Council? We have always believed that the Kashmir problem should be settled through direct talks between India and Pakistan in accordance with the declarations and decision these two countries have adopted. We also adhere to this position when it is proposed that the Kashmir problem be discussed at the UN.  How will the crisis between Iran and the United States affect the peace process in Afghanistan?  I think the aggravation of relations between Iran and the United States will probably not be conducive to resolving any crisis in the region, but only increase tensions. The tragedy with the Ukrainian plane is a serious wake-up call and signal to start de-escalation rather than engage in constant threats and military flights in this region. In practical terms, we know that the United States is one of the main players in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. It leads an entire coalition, has its troops deployed in Afghanistan and has resumed talks with the Taliban. We support this. We believe it is critical to reach an agreement, which will allow talks to begin between all the Afghans. After all, this pre-requisite advanced by the Taliban was accepted. We are trying to help this process. In parallel with our own contacts with the Taliban, who we are encouraging to agree on things and start a direct dialogue with other political forces in Afghanistan, we have a tripartite channel of communication with the Americans and the Chinese, which was recently joined by Pakistan. We believe it would be the right thing to do, if Iran joined the United States, China, Russia and Pakistan in their informal exchanges about how to promote a settlement. In principle, this is possible. As I understand, what stands in the way is the anti-Iranian slant of the US policy and Iran's reluctance in this situation to talk with the Americans and help them resolve particular issues. From all points of view, it is nevertheless necessary to de-escalate relations between the United States and Iran, but this will require state wisdom. These relations are unlikely move away from the dangerous line if Washington continues to publicly blame Iran for all the region's sins. Whatever country you take, Iran is to blame for everything. Everywhere you look, Washington is demanding that Iran stop developing ties and exerting influence. This is unrealistic. All countries in this and other regions have their interests. They project them onto their friends and neighbours. Most importantly, these interests should be advanced legitimately. Unfortunately, this does not always happen. Look at the illegal presence of the antiterrorist coalition in eastern Syria, which, in fact, contributes to fuelling the separatist sentiment. This is actually a serious problem. So, it's best for everyone to sit down and talk. As you may be aware, Iran first proposed to conclude a non-aggression pact between Iran and the Arab countries of the Gulf, and then came up with the Hormuz Peace Initiative to cooperate on ensuring security in these waters. We practice a similar approach. I have already mentioned in my opening remarks that we have put forward a Concept of Collective Security in the Gulf and adjacent areas. We have in mind not only the need to gather all the Gulf coastal countries, Arabs and Iranians at one table, but also to reinforce their efforts with the participation of external players. I mean the League of Arab States, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and the European Union. I think that this configuration can be used to launch the work of a conference on security and trust in this region. If this process can be started, other countries in the region could join it later, more broadly, other countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Unfortunately, the differences between individual Arab countries of the Gulf and the Iranians are too deep. In our contacts with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Iranians themselves, we want them to start a dialogue among themselves. There seems to be an understanding of this, but so far we have not been able to convince our friends to begin this work.  I have a question about the Ukrainian Boeing. It was widely discussed last week. The Iranian and Russian approaches were compared in connection with the MH17 flight, and not in a completely favourable way. Do you agree with Margarita Simonyan that in this case Iran acted \"like a real man\" unlike other countries, including Russia? I wanted to ask about the Foreign Ministry's position that it made public last week. Until recently, various representatives of the Ministry said it was Western misinformation. Although in fact there was a lot of evidence, and even without access to intelligence it could be seen with the naked eye that something had happened at an altitude of 2,500 metres. It turned out that this was not true. Do you see any reason to apologise to the families of the people who died?  I do not recall the Foreign Ministry officially saying that the version that the plane was shot down was misinformation. You can refute me if you have facts.  I think your deputy Sergey Ryabkov provided the comment.  We did not and could not have made any official statements. We only wanted the truth to be established. As, in fact, we want to establish the truth with regard to the Malaysian Boeing. Answering the previous question, I mentioned the tragedy with the Ukrainian plane in connection with escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran. I don't want to justify anyone. This was a human error. I think everyone has already realised that it was unintentional. The surviving families are entitled to claim compensation. I think Iran will look into these claims. They admitted that it happened by mistake. I do not want to convince anyone that this could not have happened. Of course, I would like this not to have happened. But, in an unprecedented operation that undermined and called into question all the conceivable norms of international law, the Americans destroyed the commander of the Quds special forces of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, General Qasem Soleimani. The Iranians responded. As we later found out, they notified Iraq before responding. There are many media reports that the Americans were duly notified, made note of it and took it for granted. But there's information that after this attack the Iranians were expecting another US attack. They did not know in what form, but there were at least six F-35 fighters in the airspace right on the Iranian border. This information is subject to double-checking, but I want to emphasise the nervousness that is always part of such situations. With regard to Iran's approach and Russia's approach, frankly, I do not understand what difference you are talking about. Once again, I want to emphasise that we, as in the case of the Ukrainian Boeing, want to have clarity with regard to the Malaysian Boeing. Let me remind you of some things that our colleagues, in particular, the Dutch, are trying not to mention. First, Russia co-sponsored UNSC Resolution 2166, which contained requirements to ensure an investigation in strict accordance with the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation. I will not provide examples of the rules that should have been complied with, but they have not been respected. Among other things, UNSCR 2166 required that the investigators report regularly to the UNSC. Not a single report was filed. A Joint Investigation Team (JIT) was formed consisting of Ukraine, Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium. Malaysia, whose Boeing was downed, was not invited. It was invited only three months later to participate in a criminal investigation team, even though it was already part of the technical team. By the way, if they had complaints against us, they could have invited us to join the JIT. No one wanted us there, but we actively cooperated nonetheless: we did everything the Netherlands-created JIT requested at any particular moment. We even gave full-scale demonstrations. Almaz-Antey Concern, which produces the Buk air defence system which was allegedly used in the shooting down of this plane, showed how this could occur in a real-life situation. They provided primary radar data. To our question about the data from the Ukrainian radars, we received the strange answer that they were not available. Then someone said that the radars had been turned off accidentally. All the radars in Ukraine that were observing this part of the airspace were \"turned off\" at some point, the same way the video surveillance was turned off in the morning when the Skripals were found on a park bench. It's just that a camera that was watching their house was turned off and then turned on. There's no answer to the question as to why the conversations between the Ukrainian dispatchers on that day were not published in full. Now, five years after the crash some recordings of the telephone conversations between Russian representatives, representatives of Donbass, have been published. It took them five years to locate telephone records. What about the Ukrainian air traffic controllers? There's no need to make any efforts to get them. These records must be made public. They just don't want to. This begs the question: where is the data from the US satellites? It was mentioned that they exist. The most interesting part is that when Malaysia was not invited to participate in this investigation right from the outset, the four countries that formed a group with Ukraine (they did not mention it, but we know it for certain) initially agreed among themselves that any information that went outside should be approved by all four members of this group, including Ukraine. When the Dutch MPs asked their government why Ukraine was never asked about the reasons for not closing the airspace, the Dutch government remained silent. There are many such questions. When the Dutch investigation, despite the fact that we provided everything we could in response to their requests, publicly declared (my colleague Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok also did this) that Russia did not cooperate with the investigation, we showed them what we did and asked why they had made such statements. Do you know the answer? \"Russia has not cooperated because it has not admitted its guilt.\" Australia and the Netherlands suggested that we hold consultations. We agreed with the understanding that we would consider all matters of interest to us, and this was agreed upon. In addition, we would answer their questions. But we wanted to discuss everything I have just mentioned with them. They shunned these discussions and tried to present things as a state of affairs in which the investigation was not finished, and we were the culprits and, they say, let's start talking about compensation. Is that what \"real men\" do or what? Not sure? I don't think so. So, when they approach this matter, the Skripals or chemical weapons in Syria exclusively from the \"highly likely\" standpoint, this is the very same story with which we started our conversation today, where instead of international law they make up the rules that are good only for them and force others to believe in them.  If I may, since Sergey Ryabkov was quoted incorrectly, I will cite his words, because otherwise we will provide an excuse for incorrect interpretations.  Lies, let me put it bluntly.  On January 10, Sergey Ryabkov literally stated the following in Tokyo, I quote: \"I'm deeply convinced that it is impossible to try to score political points using this terrible human tragedy. We need to let the experts analyse the situation and draw their conclusions. Starting any kind of games here is, at least, unseemly.\" Here's another direct quote: \"There's no reason to make any loud statements at this point.\" End of quote. The New START Treaty is set to expire in February 2021. President Vladimir Putin and you are saying that no messages are forthcoming from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, and that it is still unclear whether the Treaty will be extended or not. But everything changes. Quite possibly, Russia is ever more persistently sending messages to Washington that it is high time to address this matter. Yes, I discussed this during my first trip to Washington in 2017 and also in December 2019. Yesterday, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov also discussed this matter with US Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security Affairs Christopher Ford.  The US side is not providing any final response and is trying to suspend discussion of the issue. In suspending the matter, they are constantly introducing the subject of involving the People's Republic of China in these talks, although we have explained our position so many times. The President of Russia has repeatedly noted that we will take part in any specific multilateral negotiating process if all the parties to this process agree. We would also take part, if the Americans believe that it is pointless to continue this process without the PRC, and if China also wants this. But the People's Republic of China has made numerous official statements that it will not take part in such talks, explaining this by the fact that the structure of the Chinese nuclear forces differs drastically from that of the United States and the Russian Federation. We have stated that we respect this position of the PRC, and that we will not force China to change it. Why should they do this, and how can we force them to change their position?  For some reason, the United States is convinced that we should undertake to talk China into responding to the US proposal. I believe that this proposal is incomprehensible. The United States boasts highly efficient channels for dialogue with China, and they have just concluded a trade agreement. Therefore I will once again reaffirm the fact that we completely respect the position of the PRC. We will take part in any multilateral configuration of talks, if everyone coordinates it. But this takes time, and if, in principle, political conditions become ripe, and if the concerned parties are ready for this multilateral process, then the talks themselves would take months, and the New START Treaty is set to expire within a year, in February 2021. President Vladimir Putin proposed to President Donald Trump and to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [when he visited Sochi in May 2019] to agree to extend this Treaty, to say the least, so that there would be some insurance policy in place, while they were trying to launch a new multilateral negotiating process. This is our position, and it remains in force. We suggest extending the New START Treaty without any preconditions, and the President of Russia reaffirmed this once again at a meeting with top leaders of the Russian Armed Forces in the autumn of 2019. I hope that the Americans have heard us. We have discussed this many times, but we have not received any clear and understandable messages from them so far.  As you know, Russia will hold the chairmanship of the Arctic Council in 2021-2023. How are we preparing for it? What is the role of our northern Arctic regions, in particular, Yamal? Do you think our Arctic agenda is effective? I believe we have a packed Arctic agenda.  It is the result of the efforts of a large inter-departmental team. It reflects our interests regarding security, navigation, the economy, energy, environmental protection and the rights of indigenous people. Indigenous peoples take part in the Arctic Council's activities. There is a special format. They regularly attend and speak at ministerial sessions. Essentially, the Arctic Council is one of the few institutions that, so far, is not associated with ideology or policy. The council makes very important decisions on cooperation in emergency situations, in particular, perish the thought, in the event of an oil spill, and also on scientific cooperation, the regulation of fishing in the Arctic Ocean and many other decisions. There is no reason for bringing military working methods to the Arctic. In this connection, we do not believe it is right to try to draw NATO into this high-latitude region but we are in favour of resuming the previous practice where the chiefs of staff of the armed forces from the member countries of the Arctic Council met only to ensure the required level of confidence. We suggest that meetings like these be resumed, beginning, probably, with expert consultations. The Arctic Council is carrying out its activities. Our agenda will ensure continuity. Currently, Iceland holds the chairmanship of the council. We maintain regular contact with the minister and we will continue to meet. As 2021 draws near, a specific agenda will be formulated to seamlessly continue the processes coordinated by all council members regarding the economy, climate protection, environmental protection in general, and, of course, the processes aimed at making the living conditions of indigenous peoples as comfortable as possible.    First of all, on behalf of myself and the Sputnik team working in Estonia, I would like to thank the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Russian Embassy in Estonia and personally Maria Zakharova for the support you provided to the Sputnik team in Estonia when we were going through hard times. I would like to remind my colleagues here that the Estonian authorities plan to bring criminal charges against the Sputnik employees in Estonia. We may be sentenced to five years in prison for working with the Rossiya Segodnya International Information Agency. So, to avoid imprisonment, the majority of our employees had to terminate their employment contracts from January 1. However, we hope to continue to get assistance from the Foreign Ministry. Yesterday, during the discussion of the outrageous situation with Russian journalists, your Estonian counterpart Urmas Reinsalu said that - I am quoting him - it has to do with the need to enhance the defence of Europe and defend freedom in Europe. That is, if we go to prison, Europe will be free. Please comment on this situation.   Do you think, given this rhetoric and, to put it mildly, the undiplomatic statements regarding Russia that were made not only by Estonian government members but the President of Estonia as well, that President Vladimir Putin will attend the Finno-Ugric Congress in Estonia this year at the invitation of [Estonian President] Kersti Kaljulaid? Did you receive an invitation from Urmas Reinsalu to take part in the celebration of the centenary of the signing of the Treaty of Tartu? You provided facts that hardly require in-depth comment. As for the concrete actions against Sputnik, I think they are outrageous. As things stand, we are requesting a response from the OSCE every day. The Council of Europe came up with a statement that more or less denounced these actions. We want to draw the Council of Europe's attention to the fact that it is their members who are speaking on the issues that fly in the face of the European values they preach. The fact that the European Union is swallowing this, unable as it is to do anything about it, is another blot on the European Union's reputation. We have already seen plenty of these blots. I have already mentioned what caused the Ukrainian crisis. I am also worried by the enviable perseverance with which the leading countries of the European Union, in particular, our French colleagues, are promoting initiatives to classify the media, identifying them as either a media outlet or a propaganda tool. I think these two things are of the same ilk, I mean, what is happening to you in real life and what is now being formulated as a concept by high-ranking officials.   As for Estonian statements and speeches, my colleague has said many times that a border treaty will not be ratified because it revokes the Treaty of Tartu and that the Pechory District must be returned to Estonia. As for the Estonian President, she asked for a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow and he met with her. It seemed to me that she adequately assessed the situation when she said that we were neighbours and that, of course, we had disagreements but we had to remain good neighbours. Something must have happened to her after she returned to her country. It is sad, because we have never tried to avoid cooperation with our colleagues. Our only requirement and a requirement of international law is that they put an end to the infamous phenomenon of statelessness, which is another blot on the European Union's reputation. Some positive trends in this field are emerging as they have started to grant citizenship to people by virtue of them being born in the country. However, they have still a long way to go before getting to the standards that agree with European values.                   Advanced settings         Switcher      6 Photos close"}
